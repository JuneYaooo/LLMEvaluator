Anthropogenic activities are the main sources of soil, air, and water pollution by metals, including cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), the metalloid arsenic (As), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu). The goal of this study was to assess the presence and concentration of toxic (As, Cd, Pb, and Cr) and essential metals (Mg, Zn, and Cu) in the liver and kidneys from 96 free-ranging rattlesnakes (Crotalus durissus) from Minas Gerais (Brazil). Bioaccumulation of Cd and Pb were significantly higher in males and heavier rattlesnakes (those with body weight above the average of the study population). Average ± standard deviations of Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, Mg, Zn, and As in the general population (n = 96) were 3.19 ± 2.52; 5.98 ± 8.49; 0.66 ± 1.97; 3.27 ± 2.85; 776.14 ± 2982.92; 27.44 ± 29.55; and 0.32 ± 1.46; respectively. Bioaccumulation of some metals correlated positively with changes in hematologic and serum biochemical parameters. Results of this study were contrasted with previous studies assessing metal bioaccumulation in other species of terrestrial or aquatic snakes. Considering their position in the food chain and the broad range of bioaccumulation of both toxic and essential metals observed in this study, rattlesnakes may function as highly relevant biological sentinels for environmental pollution.
