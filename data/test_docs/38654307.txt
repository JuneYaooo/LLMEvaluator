BACKGROUND: The relationship between venous congestion in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and acute kidney injury (AKI) in cardiac surgery has not utterly substantiated. This study aimed at investigate the relationship between CVP in CPB and the occurrence of AKI.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 2048 consecutive patients with cardiovascular disease undergoing cardiac procedure with CPB from January 2018 to December 2022. We used the median CVP value obtained during CPB for our analysis and patients were grouped according to this parameter. The primary outcomes were AKI and renal replacement therapy(RRT). Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the association between CVP and AKI.
RESULTS: A total of 2048 patients were enrolled in our study and divided into high CVP group (CVP ≥ 6.5 mmHg) and low CVP group (CVP < 6.5 mmHg) according to the median CVP value. Patients in high CVP group had the high AKI and RRT rate when compared to the low CVPgroup[(367/912,40.24%)vs.(408/1136,35.92%),P = 0.045;(16/912,1.75%vs.9/1136;0.79%), P = 0.049]. Multivariate logistic regression analysis displayed CVP played an indispensable part in development of renal failure in surgical.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CVP(≥ 6.5mmHOmmHg) in CPB during cardiac operation is associated with an increased risk of AKI in cardiovascular surgery patients. Clinical attention should be paid to the potential role of CVP in predicting the occurrence of AKI.
