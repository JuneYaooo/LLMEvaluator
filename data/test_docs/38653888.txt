INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have detected mitochondrial alterations in tissues of individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Metabolic surgery could be an effective treatment to improve mitochondrial morphology and reduce oxidative stress (OS).
METHODS: An experimental study was carried out using 48 male Wistar rats, divided into 6 groups (n = 8): control (C), induced Metabolic Syndrome (MS); intervention with sleeve gastrectomy (SG), MS + SG with 6 weeks postoperatively (MS + SG6), MS + SG with 12 weeks postoperatively (MS + SG12), and MS + SG with 24 weeks postoperatively (MS + SG24). Biochemical markers indicative of MS (glycemia, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels) and oxidative stress markers (nitric oxide levels, Superoxide dismutase and Myeloperoxidase activity) were determined. To study mitochondrial morphology, tissue sections of the thoracic aorta, stomach, liver, heart, and kidney were observed by electron microscopy.
RESULTS: MS group exhibited elevated glycemic values and dyslipidemia. SG and MS + SG groups showed improvements in glycemia and lipid profiles compared to MS. OS biomarkers indicated reduced oxidative stress in SG and MS + SG groups compared to MS. Electron microscopy revealed mitochondrial alterations in MS. SG group showed no changes compared to the control. MS + SG6 and MS + SG12 groups showed a recovery of mitochondrial morphology until reaching images similar to the control in MS + SG24.
CONCLUSION: Metabolic surgery could improve mitochondrial function by restoring mitochondrial morphology and architecture and, consequently, reducing systemic oxidative stress and remitting associated metabolic alterations.
