PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the risk factors for liver disease comorbidity among older adults in eastern, central, and western China, and explored binary, ternary and quaternary co-morbid co-causal patterns of liver disease within a health ecological model.
METHOD: Basic information from 9,763 older adults was analyzed using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). LASSO regression was employed to identify significant predictors in eastern, central, and western China. Patterns of liver disease comorbidity were studied using association rules, and spatial distribution was analyzed using a geographic information system. Furthermore, binary, ternary, and quaternary network diagrams were constructed to illustrate the relationships between liver disease comorbidity and co-causes.
RESULTS: Among the 9,763 elderly adults studied, 536 were found to have liver disease comorbidity, with binary or ternary comorbidity being the most prevalent. Provinces with a high prevalence of liver disease comorbidity were primarily concentrated in Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, and Henan. The most common comorbidity patterns identified were "liver-heart-metabolic", "liver-kidney", "liver-lung", and "liver-stomach-arthritic". In the eastern region, important combination patterns included "liver disease-metabolic disease", "liver disease-stomach disease", and "liver disease-arthritis", with the main influencing factors being sleep duration of less than 6Â h, frequent drinking, female, and daily activity capability. In the central region, common combination patterns included "liver disease-heart disease", "liver disease-metabolic disease", and "liver disease-kidney disease", with the main influencing factors being an education level of primary school or below, marriage, having medical insurance, exercise, and no disabilities. In the western region, the main comorbidity patterns were "liver disease-chronic lung disease", "liver disease-stomach disease", "liver disease-heart disease", and "liver disease-arthritis", with the main influencing factors being general or poor health satisfaction, general or poor health condition, severe pain, and no disabilities.
CONCLUSION: The comorbidities associated with liver disease exhibit specific clustering patterns at both the overall and local levels. By analyzing the comorbidity patterns of liver diseases in different regions and establishing co-morbid co-causal patterns, this study offers a new perspective and scientific basis for the prevention and treatment of liver diseases.
