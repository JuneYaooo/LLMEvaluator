BACKGROUND: This study evaluated parenting stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms and their associated factors in parents of children with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
METHODS: This cross-sectional study compared parents of patients with CKD (0-18Â years) with a matched control group of parents of healthy children. Both groups completed the Parenting Stress Index - Short Form, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and a sociodemographic questionnaire.
RESULTS: The study group consisted of 45 parents (median age 39; 32 mothers) of CKD patients (median age 8; 36% female). Nearly 75% of children had CKD stages 2, 3, or 4, and 44.5% had congenital anomaly of the kidney and urinary tract. Five children (11%) were on dialysis, and 4 (9%) had a functioning kidney graft. Compared with parents of healthy children, more stress and anxiety symptoms were reported. Since the CKD diagnosis, 47% of parents perceived a deterioration of their own health, and 40% reduced work on a structural basis. Higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms were associated with a more negative perception of own health, and more child medical comorbidities and school absence.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed higher levels of parenting stress and anxiety symptoms in parents of children with CKD compared with parents of healthy children. This was associated with a less positive perception of their own health, especially if the child had more medical comorbidities or more absence from school. Psychosocial interventions to reduce the parental burden should be integrated in the standard care of pediatric nephrology departments.
