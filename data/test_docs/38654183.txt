BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, Measurement of estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) is the gold standard assessing renal function the glomerular filtration rate often estimated from plasma creatinine. Several studies have shown Cystatin C based eGFR (Cys C) to be a better parameter for the diagnosis of impaired renal function. Cystatin C based eGFR has been proposed as a potential renal function marker but its use in HIV&AIDS patients has not been well evaluated.
METHODS: A cross sectional study was carried out on 914 HIV&AIDS patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) attending Mildmay Uganda for care and treatment between January to March 2015. Serum Cystatin C based eGFR was measured using the particle enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay. Creatinine was analyzed using enzymatic Creatinine PAP method and creatinine clearance was calculated according to C&G.
RESULTS: The sensitivity of Cystatin C based eGFR was 15.1% (95% CI = 8.4, 24) with specificity 99.3% (95% CI = 98- 99.7). The positive and negative predictive values were 70.0% (95% CI 45.7-88.1) and 91.2% (95% CI 98.11-92.94) respectively. The positive likelihood ratio was 18.81 and negative likelihood ratio was 0.85. Cystatin C based eGFR had diagnostic accuracy of 90.7 and area under curve was 0.768.
CONCLUSION: Cystatin C based eGFR exhibited a high specificity and a high positive likelihood ratio in diagnosis of kidney disease among HIV&AIDS patients. Cystatin C based eGFR can be used as a confirmatory test.
