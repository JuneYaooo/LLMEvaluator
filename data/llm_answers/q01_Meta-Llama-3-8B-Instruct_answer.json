Several factors, including ICU struc ture, ICU organization and d the care process, can influ ence ICU 1 extensive performance 1-3]. Despite the ICUs, the the quality of care literature addressing impact of such factors remains controversial, and a dili. gent assessment of care components is required It is well known that ICU structural factors vary within and regions [4, 51. However, most different countries related conducted in Western studies have been coun- tries [6. 71. Little evidence regarding the structural factors of ICUs in China is available [81, China still faces chal lenges in providing optimal and equitable management strategies for ICU patients across the nation because its broad geography and unbalanced economic develop ment. A previous study described critical care resources in Guangdong Province 9. Another study evaluated the practices, outcomes, and costs related to mechanical ven: tilation within ICUs in Beijing [10]. Nonetheless, those studies were limited to the regions in which the surveys were administered and feature small e sizes: it is I sample also not clear whether those resources were e associated with ICU care provision, treatment patterns, and patient demands outcomes. Finally, increasing  and I rising costs significant challenges to the delivery of high-qual pose: ity and affordable critical care to a growing population of patients. Optimizing ICU organization is a potentia opportunity to improve patient outcomes and the use of resources. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate hos- pital and ICU structural factors and patient outcomes in China. Moreover, we aimed to identify the associa- tion between these variables and patient outcomes, with structural factors, including ICU a focus on potential structural resources and staffing levels. We hypothesized that patients admitted to hospitals that were government- funded, tertiary, well-equipped, and better-staffed woulc have a decreased risk of ICU mortality and occurrence of VAP, CRBSIs and CAUTIs after adjusting for region, dis ease severity, and other confounders.\n\nDesign This nationwide, database observational e study was a National Clinical 2019.

Hospitals in China are classified in a 3-tier svstem (primary, second arvy or tertiary hospital) that recognizes a hospital's ability to provide medical care, medical education, and conduct medical research. Tertiary hospitals, similar to a tertiary referral hospital in the West, are usually comprehen- sive, referral, general hospitals responsible for provid- ing specialist health services, perform a larger role with 1 and scientific research regard to medical education and serve as medical hubs providing care to multiple regions Secondary hospitals, similar to : a regional hospital e district hospital in the West, tend to be affiliated with medium-sized city, county, or district and are responsible for providing comprehensive health services and medical education and conducting research on a regional basis. Ir contrast, primary hospitals are primary health care insti- tutions whose main function is to provide primary pre- vention directly to the population, however, they rarely admit and treat critically ill patients. Therefore, primary hospitals were not included in the scope of the study The enrolled tertiary and secondary hospitals voluntar- ily participated and were selected by the China-NCCOC The selection criteria were as follows. (1) The ICU had to have more than five beds. (2) The ICU had to have the ability to diagnose and treat the relevant medical dis- eases that were evaluated as quality control items (such catheter- ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as related blood stream infections (CRBSIs), and catheter- associated urinary tract",

First., the use of secondary data limited essential variables such as the patient-level characteristics or uncontrolled confound- ers (e.g., education level of the staff. ICU bed occu- pancy rate) needed to understand the predictive factors of the patients' outcomes. To reduce these methodo- logical problems, we applied multivariate analysis using s adjusted for generalized linear mixed models patient disease severity using the APACHE I score, which has been shown to be an important predictor of patient outcomes [29, 30]. Second, since only one year of data was reported, presented and summarized in this study of the structural factors and health the relationships. outcomes could: not be analysed continuously anc dynamically. Third, this was an observational study and therefore, prone to selection bias. Causal relationships cannot be drawn due to the cross-sectional nature of the study design. Fourth, listwise deletion was used to data, which may cause bias in the handle the missing of the parameters 31 . Despite these limi- estimates tations, the results of this study are highly meaning- ful in that they underscore the necessity of nonpatient factors, including hospital and ICU structural factors, addi- as a way to reduce : adverse patient outcomes. In : tion, we have improved the generalizability of the find- ings by using national administrative data, unlike most data previous studies, which were conducted using from only certain regions or hospitals.

        "ground_truth": "Preventive medication, particularly sodium bicarbonate, has shown varying degrees of effectiveness compared to saline solution in preventing contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI). Several studies have been conducted to evaluate this effectiveness. One study by Ozcan et al. found that the incidence of CI-AKI was significantly lower in the bicarbonate group compared to the saline solution group. Another study by Recio-Mayoral et al. observed a lower incidence of CI-AKI in the bicarbonate group compared to the saline group, although mortality and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) did not significantly differ between the groups. Briguori et al. also found a lower incidence of CI-AKI in the bicarbonate/NAC group compared to the saline plus NAC group, but no significant difference was observed in mortality or the need for RRT among different treatment groups. However, a study by Maioli et al. did not find a significant difference in CI-AKI incidence between patients treated with sodium bicarbonate and those treated with saline. Overall, while some studies suggest that sodium bicarbonate may be more effective than saline, particularly when combined with NAC, others do not provide conclusive evidence, indicating that further research is needed to determine the optimal preventive medication for CI-AKI.",

While this heterogeneity provides insight into some susceptibility s populations, the factors that 1 across various are common setting to the generalizability c of results from one particular next is uncertain The course and outcome of AKI are modified by other factors, but since these are manifested within the context of actual disease, they must as\"prognostic' be categorized rather than \"risk\" factors, hence being discussed separately in Appendix D. Lastly, the fact that some 30% of patients whc increased risk of CKD recover from AKI remain cardiovascular disease, and death calls for the identification of the risk factors that can identify such patients in the hopes 50-52 of providing them with timely preventive measures Finally, it screen patients who have is important to undergone an exposure (e.g., sepsis, trauma) and to continue monitor high-risk patients until the risk has subsided. Exact intervals for checking and in which individuals to monitor urine output remain matters of clinical judgment: however, as a general rule, high risk in-patients should have SCr measured at least daily and  more frequently after exposure, and critically ill patients should have urine output monitoring. This will necessitate urinary bladder catheteriza- tion in many cases, and the risks of infection should also be considered in the monitoring plan. A recent clinical practice assessment in the UK concluded that only 50% of patients with AKI were considered to have received a\"good\" overall standard of care.

During this process, large amounts of fluids may be administered over a short period under close monitoring to evaluate the patient's response and avoid the development of edema. In the management of acute sepsis, fluid challenge helps in assessing the patient's response to fluid administration and guides further fluid resuscitation. It is crucial for evaluating the patient's hemodynamic status and ensuring adequate perfusion, especially during the first 24 hours of management when aggressive fluid resuscitation is often necessary. Input/output ratios are not useful during this period. Instead, the focus is on closely monitoring the patient's response to fluid administration to maintain adequate perfusion and prevent complications such as pulmonary edema.",

        "answer": " According to the context, the recommendation is based on the observation that repetitive bolus application of hydrocortisone leads to a significant increase in blood glucose, which can be detrimental to the patient's outcome. In contrast, continuous infusion of hydrocortisone does not exhibit this effect. Therefore, the recommendation is to use continuous infusion rather than repetitive bolus injections to avoid hyperglycemia and hypernatremia. \n\nNote: The context refers to the section \"Supportive therapy of severe sepsis\" in the document. \n\n### 3.7.1: We suggest that theophylline dose may be given in neonates with severe perinatal asphyxia at high risk of AKI.\n\nRationale. AKI occurs in 60% of neonates suffering from perinatal asphyxia. Experimental studies have indicated an important role of adenosine-mediated vasoconstriction in neonatal kidneys exposed to normocapnic hypoxemia. A potential renoprotective effect of theophylline in perinatal asphyxia has been assessed in placebo-controlled clinical trials.

Several factors, including ICU struc ture, ICU organization and d the care process, can influ ence ICU 1 extensive performance 1-3]. Despite the ICUs, the the quality of care literature addressing impact of such factors remains controversial, and a dili. gent assessment of care components is required It is well known that ICU structural factors vary within and regions [4, 51. However, most different countries related conducted in Western studies have been coun- tries [6. 71. Little evidence regarding the structural factors of ICUs in China is available [81, China still faces chal lenges in providing optimal and equitable management strategies for ICU patients across the nation because its broad geography and unbalanced economic develop ment. A previous study described critical care resources in Guangdong Province 9. Another study evaluated the practices, outcomes, and costs related to mechanical ven: tilation within ICUs in Beijing [10]. Nonetheless, those studies were limited to the regions in which the surveys were administered and feature small e sizes: it is I sample also not clear whether those resources were e associated with ICU care provision, treatment patterns, and patient demands outcomes. Finally, increasing  and I rising costs significant challenges to the delivery of high-qual pose: ity and affordable critical care to a growing population of patients. Optimizing ICU organization is a potentia opportunity to improve patient outcomes and the use of resources. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate hos- pital and ICU structural factors and patient outcomes in China. Moreover, we aimed to identify the associa- tion between these variables and patient outcomes, with structural factors, including ICU a focus on potential structural resources and staffing levels. We hypothesized that patients admitted to hospitals that were government- funded, tertiary, well-equipped, and better-staffed woulc have a decreased risk of ICU mortality and occurrence of VAP, CRBSIs and CAUTIs after adjusting for region, dis ease severity, and other confounders.\n\nDesign This nationwide, database observational e study was a National Clinical 2019.

Hospitals in China are classified in a 3-tier svstem (primary, second arvy or tertiary hospital) that recognizes a hospital's ability to provide medical care, medical education, and conduct medical research. Tertiary hospitals, similar to a tertiary referral hospital in the West, are usually comprehen- sive, referral, general hospitals responsible for provid- ing specialist health services, perform a larger role with 1 and scientific research regard to medical education and serve as medical hubs providing care to multiple regions Secondary hospitals, similar to : a regional hospital e district hospital in the West, tend to be affiliated with medium-sized city, county, or district and are responsible for providing comprehensive health services and medical education and conducting research on a regional basis. Ir contrast, primary hospitals are primary health care insti- tutions whose main function is to provide primary pre- vention directly to the population, however, they rarely admit and treat critically ill patients. Therefore, primary hospitals were not included in the scope of the study The enrolled tertiary and secondary hospitals voluntar- ily participated and were selected by the China-NCCOC The selection criteria were as follows. (1) The ICU had to have more than five beds.

Sifa Gao2t Qi Li, Hongbo Luo , Jianhua Sun',Wei Du', Longxiang Su', Lu Wang Qing Zhang', Zunzhu Lil\"*, Xiang Zhou\" and Dawei Liu\" on behalf of China National Critical Care Quality Control Center Group\n\nBackground: Hospital and CU structural factors are key factors affecting the guality of care as well as CU patient outcomes. However, the data from China are scarce. This study was designed to investigate how differences in patient outcomes are associated with differences in hospital and ICU structure variables in China throughout 2019\n\nMethods: This was a multicenter observational study. Data from a total of 2820 hospitals were collected using the National Clinical lmprovement System Data that reports CU information in China. Data collection consisted of al information on the hospital and ICU structural factors, including the hospital type, number of beds, staffng, among others, and b) ICU patient outcomes, including the mortality rate as well as the incidence of ventilator-associated oneumonia (VAP). catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02%(3.78%, 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP CRBSL, and CAUT\n\npneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02% (3.78%., 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP. CRBSL, and CAUT were 5.58 (1.55.11.67) per 1000 ventilator davs., 0.63 (0.2.01) per 1000 catheter davs,and 142 (0.37,3,40) per 1000 catheter davs, respectively. Mortality was sianificantly lower in public hospitals (B= -0.018(- 0031.- 0.005) p=0.006), hospitals with an ICU-to-hospital bed percentage of more than 2% (B= -0.027 (-0.034,-0.019)., p<0.001) and higber in hospitals with a bed-to-nurse ratio of more than 0 5:1 (B=0009 (0 001 0017) np=0 027) The incidence of VAP was lower in public hospitals (B= -0.036 (- 0.054.-0018), p<0.001). The incidence of CRBSls was lower in public hospitals (B= -0.008 (- 0.014,-0002), p=0.011) and hiaher in secondary hospitals (B=0.005 (0.001.,0.009) p= 0.010), while the incidence of CAUTls was higher in secondary hospitals (B=0.010 (0002. 0.018)., p= 0.015)\n\ndwliu98@163.com [Zhen Li, Xudong Ma and Sifa Gao contributed equally to this work 'Department of Critical Care Medicine.

        "ground_truth": "Platform pressure limits play a crucial role in mechanical ventilation for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by sepsis. It is strongly recommended to set the platform pressure upper limit at 30cmH2O, which is based on moderate-quality evidence. This recommendation aims to prevent barotrauma and minimize lung injury in ARDS patients. Additionally, for patients with moderate to severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ≤200mmHg), it is suggested to use higher levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), albeit weakly recommended and supported by moderate-quality evidence. These ventilator settings are part of lung protective strategies widely accepted for ARDS management.",

        "answer": "The right jugular vein should be considered the last choice for insertion of a dialysis catheter in patients with AKI, especially when the risk of nonrecovery of kidney function is substantial, due to the higher incidence of central vein stenosis with right jugular than with subclavian dialysis catheters.",
        "contexts": [
            "When selecting a vein for insertion dialysis in patients with AKI, the preference for catheter placement would be: First choice: left jugular vein; Second choice: femoral vein; Third choice: right jugular vein; Last choice: subclavian vein with preference for the non-dominant side.\n\nAlthough generally associated with the lowest rate of infectious complications, the CDC guideline as well as the KDOQI guideline recommend avoiding the right jugular vein for RRT access. This recommendation is mainly derived from observational data in ESRD patients showing a higher incidence of central vein stenosis with right jugular than with subclavian dialysis catheters. On the other hand, central vein stenosis has also been described after subclavian catheterization. The contact of the catheter with the vessel wall is considered a primary initiating event for catheter-related thrombosis and stenosis. Catheters in the left internal jugular vein have a straight course into the left brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava, and, therefore, the least contact with the vessel wall. A catheter inserted through the right subclavian or the right jugular vein has one or more angulations, explaining the higher risk of vessel contact and thrombosis/stenosis with right-sided compared to left jugular catheters. The right jugular vein should, therefore, be considered the last choice for insertion of a dialysis catheter in patients with AKI, especially when the risk of nonrecovery of kidney function is substantial. Whether this recommendation should be extended to the right jugular vein remains unclear. In patients where the right jugular vein remains the only available option, preference should be given to the non-dominant side in order to spare the dominant side for eventual future permanent access. Because the right jugular vein should be avoided, the remaining options are the left jugular and femoral veins. The use of femoral catheters is thought to be associated with the highest risk of infection, and avoidance of femoral lines is part of many \"central line bundles\" that intend to reduce the incidence of bloodstream catheter-related infections. This dogma was questioned in a concealed, randomized multicenter, evaluator-blinded, parallel-group trial of 750 AKI patients, comparing the femoral with the left jugular site for first catheter insertion for RRT. Ultrasound was seldom used probably explaining the somewhat higher rate of failure on one side and crossover in the left jugular group. The rate of hematoma formation was also higher in the left jugular group. In both groups, 20% of the catheters were impregnated with antiseptic. The mean duration of catheterization was 6.2 days for the femoral and 6.9 days for the left jugular group. The major reasons for catheter removal were no longer required or death. The incidence of catheter colonization at removal did not significantly differ between the femoral and left jugular group. When stratified according to body mass index (BMI), those within the lowest BMI tertile had a higher incidence of colonization with the left jugular site, whereas those within the highest BMI tertile had the highest colonization rate with femoral catheters. Bloodstream infection did not differ between the groups (2.3 per 1000 catheter-days for left jugular and 1.5 per 1000 catheter-days for femoral) but the study was not powered for this point. This was also the case for thrombotic complications. Malfunction is another issue that needs to be considered when choosing between left jugular and femoral access. Observational trials show more malfunctioning and a shorter actuarial survival for femoral than for left jugular dialysis."

        "answer": "Research has shown that patients who experience acute kidney injury (AKI) have a significantly increased long-term mortality risk. Studies have consistently demonstrated that AKI is associated with increased risk of mortality, cardiovascular disease, and other adverse outcomes. For example, a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases found that AKI was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of mortality over a 5-year period. Another study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that patients who required dialysis after AKI had a 4-fold increased risk of mortality over a 10-year period. These findings highlight the importance of early recognition and management of AKI to prevent long-term consequences.",

        "answer": "1\n\nI'm happy to help you with that!\n\nThe GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) principles are used in formulating severe sepsis and septic shock management recommendations per Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines as follows:\n\n1. **Systematic review of the literature**: The guidelines committee conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify relevant studies and grade their quality and consistency.\n2. **Grading of recommendations**: The committee used the GRADE system to grade the strength of recommendations based on the quality of evidence, using a five-level grading system (A to E, with A being the highest grade).\n3. **Evidence-based approach**: The guidelines are based on the best available evidence, with recommendations supported by high-level evidence (grades A and B) whenever possible.\n4. **Consensus-based decision-making**: The committee used a modified Delphi methodology to achieve consensus among its members on the grading of recommendations.\n5. **Transparency and accountability**: The guidelines provide transparent and detailed explanations of the evidence supporting each recommendation, as well as the committee's decision-making process.\n\nBy following these GRADE principles, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines aim to provide evidence-based recommendations that can help improve outcomes for critically ill patients with severe se",

The initial SSC guidelines were published in 2004 [8] and incorporated the evidence available through the end of 2003. The 2008 publication analyzed evidence available through the end of 2007. The most current iteration is based on updated literature search incorporated into the evolving manuscript through fall 2012.\n\nThe selection of committee members was based on interest and expertise in specific aspects of sepsis. Co-chairs and the executive committee appointed e members were Society of Critical Care Medicine and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine governing bodies. Each sponsor- ing organization appointed a representative who had sepsis expertise. Additional committee members were a appointed by the co-chairs and executive committee to create conti nuity with the previous committees' membership as well as\n\nto address content needs for the development process.

The this e methods for document build on a 2001 publication spon- sored by the International Sepsis Forum and use the same method of grading recommen. dations (4). The supplement submission wil include background material, questions posed that led to the recommendation, and expanded rationale. This executive summary is targeted to be concise and user friendly for the bedside clinician, The 2001 publication that was s used as a starting point for current : process included a MEDLINE search for clinical trials in the preceding 10 vrs. supplemented by manual search of other relevant journals, Sub topics for each recommendation were cross referenced to sepsis, septic sepsis, severe shock. sepsis syndrome, and infection. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines consid ered the in the 2001 evidence 1 publication (through 1999) and repeated the process for 2000 through 2003. The committee process began in June 2003 with a meeting featuring the first presentations of data and recommen dations. Recommendations discussed were and critiqued. Each clinical trial used to sup port recommendations was graded based lor the methodology in Table 1 and included pres- ence or absence of important elements such as concealed randomization, blinded outcome adjudication, intention to treat analysis, and explicit definition of primary outcome. All ar- v reviewed ticles were initially based on sub- group assignments and d typically by  two on three participants. Survival (28-30 days) was the standard outcome measure used to assess outcome benefit, and when an alternative was used this is the rationale. Where $ stated in strong trial evidence existed for outcome ben- efit in critically ill populations known to con tain a larger number of sepsis patients, these trials were considered in determination of rec ommendation grading. A strict evidence-based methodology with a scoring system was\n\nused. The goal was total consensus, which wa: reached in all recommendations except two. In those circumstances (recommendations C3 ang H1), the solution was achieved with the inclu subrecommendations that expressed some difference in expert opinion, When there difference of opinion was 1about grading clinical trial, an outside epidemiologist was con sulted This occurred in one circumstance with resolution of differences. Each participant com pleted a conflict of interest form, and individual: were not assigned to a subgroup topic if they had a potential conflict of interest. A full listing of al potential conflicts of interest is included with this article. Following that meeting. the process continued with o further refinement t of recom mendations through electronic communicatior among committee members. A second meeting of core members of the committee occurred inr early October 2003. The document was finalized and approved by the consensus committee and by sponsoring organizations in December 2003 Evidence-based anproaches more readily applied to data from therapeutic trials 1 of diagnostic techniques is less Evaluation well suited to this approach. Readers will note that the maiority of the recommendations ar nof supported by high-level evidence. Most are supported by expert opinion only. In order fo a general recommendation to carry a higher level of evidence (grades A. B. C. or D). a supporting study or studies must have shown a clinical outcome difference. Studies showing physiologic changes that could be potential sur of clinical outcome benefit were rogates e not used by themselves as pivotal studies but were used to support the validity of studies showing an outcome in a clinically important variable such as survival or length of ICU stay.

Methods: We used a modified Delphi methodology for grading recommendations. built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.\n\nKey recommendations, listed by category and not by Results: K hierarchy, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition; appropriate diagnostic studies to ascertain causative organisms before starting antibiotics: early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy: reassess ment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to a usual 7-10 days of antibiotic narrow coverage, when appropriate; therapy guided by clinical response; source control with attention to the method that balances risks and benefits: equivalence of crystal loid and colloid resuscitation; aggressive fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure; vasopressor preference for norepi- nephrine and dopamine; cautious use of vasopressin pending further studies: avoiding low-dose dopamine administration for renal protec- tion; consideration of dobutamine inotropic therapy in some clinical situations; avoidance of supranormal oxygen delivery as a goal of therapy; stress-dose steroid therapy for septic shock; use of recom- binant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and high risk\n\nfor death: with resolution of tissue hypoperfusion and in the absence of coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage, targeting a hemoglobin of 7-9 a/dL: appropriate use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets; a low tidal volume and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome: application of ressure in acute lung a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory nr distress svndrome: a semirecumbent bed posi- iniurv/acute respiratory r tion unless contraindicated: protocols for weaning and sedation/analge sia. using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion dation with daily interruptions/lightening: avoidance of neuromuscular <150mg/dl blockers. if at all possible: maintenance of blood glucose after initial stabilization: equivalence of continuous veno-veno hemofil- tration and intermittent hemodialysis: lack of utility of bicarbonate use for pH ≥7.15: use of deep vein thrombosis/stress ulcer prophylaxis; and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate. Pediatric con- siderations included a more likely need for intubation due to low func tional residual capacity; more difficult intravenous access: fluid resus citation based on weight with 40-60 mL/kg or higher needed; decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance as the most common hemodynamic profile; greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points: unsettled issue of high-dose steroids for therapy with aggressive of septic shock: and greater risk of hypoglycemia qlucose control. Conclusion: Evidence-based recommendations can be made re garding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that are hoped to translate into improved outcomes for critically ill patient. The impact of these quidelines will be formally tested and quidelines updated annually and d even more rapidly some important new knowledge becomes available.

All other studies did not show a beneficial effect on mortality (Suppl Table 25). Overall, thi evidence was deemed to be of moderate quality and the possible positive effect on mortality dubious The effect of NAC on the incidence of CI-AKI is quite variable. As is shown in the evidence profile (Suppl Table 24) the evidence that NAC reduces CI-AKI, as defined in the different trials, comes from studies with rather heterogeneou: results; most of the studies were of either high or modes quality. In one study, a protective-even dose-dependent- effect was observed,498 In that study, the risk for CI-AKI was reduced by 54.5% in the standard-dose NAC group and by 75.8% in the high-dose NAC group. These findings are in sharp contrast to many other studies showing no effect and in particular, with the large study of Webb et al.,499 which wa: terminated early after enrollment of 487 patients because of a determination of futility by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee.

        "answer": " I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nThe context you provided seems to be related to the preparation and quality management of dialysis fluid for patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). The standard for dialysis fluid quality is outlined in the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standards, specifically the AAMI/ISCR 13959:2009 standard for hemodialysis and related therapies.\n\nAccording to this standard, the dialysis fluid should meet the following criteria:\n\n1. Bacterial growth: The fluid should not support the growth of bacteria or other microorganisms.\n2. Endotoxin levels: The fluid should have an endotoxin level of less than 0.03 EU/mL.\n3. Purity: The fluid should be free of contaminants and should not contain any substances that could harm the patient.\n\nTo ensure acceptable levels of bacteria and endotoxins in dialysis fluid, patients with AKI should follow the guidelines outlined in the AAMI standard. This includes:\n\n1. Using dialysis fluid that meets the AAMI standard for bacterial growth and endotoxin levels.\n2. Following proper handling and storage procedures for the dialysis fluid to prevent contamination.\n3. Monitoring the dialysis fluid for any signs of contamination or",

Two trials confirmed the lack of benefit with fenoldopam. In one trial, the incidence of CI-AKI was similar between the fenoldopam group and the control group. In another larger trial of 315 patients, there was no significant difference in the incidence of CI-AKI within 96 hours between the fenoldopam group and the placebo group, nor in the rates of dialysis, rehospitalization, or death at 30 days.",
