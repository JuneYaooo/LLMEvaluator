Sifa Gao2t Qi Li, Hongbo Luo , Jianhua Sun',Wei Du', Longxiang Su', Lu Wang Qing Zhang', Zunzhu Lil\"*, Xiang Zhou\" and Dawei Liu\" on behalf of China National Critical Care Quality Control Center Group\n\nBackground: Hospital and CU structural factors are key factors affecting the guality of care as well as CU patient outcomes. However, the data from China are scarce. This study was designed to investigate how differences in patient outcomes are associated with differences in hospital and ICU structure variables in China throughout 2019\n\nMethods: This was a multicenter observational study. Data from a total of 2820 hospitals were collected using the National Clinical lmprovement System Data that reports CU information in China. Data collection consisted of al information on the hospital and ICU structural factors, including the hospital type, number of beds, staffng, among others, and b) ICU patient outcomes, including the mortality rate as well as the incidence of ventilator-associated oneumonia (VAP). catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02%(3.78%, 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP CRBSL, and CAUT\n\npneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02% (3.78%., 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP. CRBSL, and CAUT were 5.58 (1.55.11.67) per 1000 ventilator davs., 0.63 (0.2.01) per 1000 catheter davs,and 142 (0.37,3,40) per 1000 catheter davs, respectively. Mortality was sianificantly lower in public hospitals (B= -0.018(- 0031.- 0.005) p=0.006), hospitals with an ICU-to-hospital bed percentage of more than 2% (B= -0.027 (-0.034,-0.019)., p<0.001) and higber in hospitals with a bed-to-nurse ratio of more than 0 5:1 (B=0009 (0 001 0017) np=0 027) The incidence of VAP was lower in public hospitals (B= -0.036 (- 0.054.-0018), p<0.001). The incidence of CRBSls was lower in public hospitals (B= -0.008 (- 0.014,-0002), p=0.011) and hiaher in secondary hospitals (B=0.005 (0.001.,0.009) p= 0.010), while the incidence of CAUTls was higher in secondary hospitals (B=0.010 (0002. 0.018)., p= 0.015)\n\ndwliu98@163.com [Zhen Li, Xudong Ma and Sifa Gao contributed equally to this work 'Department of Critical Care Medicine.

Several factors, including ICU struc ture, ICU organization and d the care process, can influ ence ICU 1 extensive performance 1-3]. Despite the ICUs, the the quality of care literature addressing impact of such factors remains controversial, and a dili. gent assessment of care components is required It is well known that ICU structural factors vary within and regions [4, 51. However, most different countries related conducted in Western studies have been coun- tries [6. 71. Little evidence regarding the structural factors of ICUs in China is available [81, China still faces chal lenges in providing optimal and equitable management strategies for ICU patients across the nation because its broad geography and unbalanced economic develop ment. A previous study described critical care resources in Guangdong Province 9. Another study evaluated the practices, outcomes, and costs related to mechanical ven: tilation within ICUs in Beijing [10]. Nonetheless, those studies were limited to the regions in which the surveys were administered and feature small e sizes: it is I sample also not clear whether those resources were e associated with ICU care provision, treatment patterns, and patient demands outcomes. Finally, increasing  and I rising costs significant challenges to the delivery of high-qual pose: ity and affordable critical care to a growing population of patients. Optimizing ICU organization is a potentia opportunity to improve patient outcomes and the use of resources. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate hos- pital and ICU structural factors and patient outcomes in China. Moreover, we aimed to identify the associa- tion between these variables and patient outcomes, with structural factors, including ICU a focus on potential structural resources and staffing levels. We hypothesized that patients admitted to hospitals that were government- funded, tertiary, well-equipped, and better-staffed woulc have a decreased risk of ICU mortality and occurrence of VAP, CRBSIs and CAUTIs after adjusting for region, dis ease severity, and other confounders.\n\nDesign This nationwide, database observational e study was a National Clinical 2019.

Hospitals in China are classified in a 3-tier svstem (primary, second arvy or tertiary hospital) that recognizes a hospital's ability to provide medical care, medical education, and conduct medical research. Tertiary hospitals, similar to a tertiary referral hospital in the West, are usually comprehen- sive, referral, general hospitals responsible for provid- ing specialist health services, perform a larger role with 1 and scientific research regard to medical education and serve as medical hubs providing care to multiple regions Secondary hospitals, similar to : a regional hospital e district hospital in the West, tend to be affiliated with medium-sized city, county, or district and are responsible for providing comprehensive health services and medical education and conducting research on a regional basis. Ir contrast, primary hospitals are primary health care insti- tutions whose main function is to provide primary pre- vention directly to the population, however, they rarely admit and treat critically ill patients. Therefore, primary hospitals were not included in the scope of the study The enrolled tertiary and secondary hospitals voluntar- ily participated and were selected by the China-NCCOC The selection criteria were as follows. (1) The ICU had to have more than five beds. (2) The ICU had to have the ability to diagnose and treat the relevant medical dis- eases that were evaluated as quality control items (such catheter- ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as related blood stream infections (CRBSIs), and catheter- associated urinary tract",
            " more advanced study. needed design and analytical approach examine the dynamic impact of nurse staffing on ICU patient outcomes There are some limitations to this study. First., the use of secondary data limited essential variables such as the patient-level characteristics or uncontrolled confound- ers (e.g., education level of the staff. ICU bed occu- pancy rate) needed to understand the predictive factors of the patients' outcomes. To reduce these methodo- logical problems, we applied multivariate analysis using s adjusted for generalized linear mixed models patient disease severity using the APACHE I score, which has been shown to be an important predictor of patient outcomes [29, 30]. Second, since only one year of data was reported, presented and summarized in this study of the structural factors and health the relationships. outcomes could: not be analysed continuously anc dynamically. Third, this was an observational study and therefore, prone to selection bias. Causal relationships cannot be drawn due to the cross-sectional nature of the study design. Fourth, listwise deletion was used to data, which may cause bias in the handle the missing of the parameters 31 . Despite these limi- estimates tations, the results of this study are highly meaning- ful in that they underscore the necessity of nonpatient factors, including hospital and ICU structural factors, addi- as a way to reduce : adverse patient outcomes. In : tion, we have improved the generalizability of the find- ings by using national administrative data, unlike most data previous studies, which were conducted using from only certain regions or hospitals.

Specific types of outcomes impacted include mortality rates, incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). For example, mortality was significantly lower in public hospitals, hospitals with an ICU-to-hospital bed percentage of more than 2%, and higher in hospitals with a bed-to-nurse ratio of more than 0.5:1. The incidence of VAP and CRBSIs was lower in public hospitals, while the incidence of CAUTIs was higher in secondary hospitals.",

Several factors, including ICU struc ture, ICU organization and d the care process, can influ ence ICU 1 extensive performance 1-3]. Despite the ICUs, the the quality of care literature addressing impact of such factors remains controversial, and a dili. gent assessment of care components is required It is well known that ICU structural factors vary within and regions [4, 51. However, most different countries related conducted in Western studies have been coun- tries [6. 71. Little evidence regarding the structural factors of ICUs in China is available [81, China still faces chal lenges in providing optimal and equitable management strategies for ICU patients across the nation because its broad geography and unbalanced economic develop ment. A previous study described critical care resources in Guangdong Province 9. Another study evaluated the practices, outcomes, and costs related to mechanical ven: tilation within ICUs in Beijing [10]. Nonetheless, those studies were limited to the regions in which the surveys were administered and feature small e sizes: it is I sample also not clear whether those resources were e associated with ICU care provision, treatment patterns, and patient demands outcomes. Finally, increasing  and I rising costs significant challenges to the delivery of high-qual pose: ity and affordable critical care to a growing population of patients. Optimizing ICU organization is a potentia opportunity to improve patient outcomes and the use of resources. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate hos- pital and ICU structural factors and patient outcomes in China. Moreover, we aimed to identify the associa- tion between these variables and patient outcomes, with structural factors, including ICU a focus on potential structural resources and staffing levels. We hypothesized that patients admitted to hospitals that were government- funded, tertiary, well-equipped, and better-staffed woulc have a decreased risk of ICU mortality and occurrence of VAP, CRBSIs and CAUTIs after adjusting for region, dis ease severity, and other confounders.\n\nDesign This nationwide, database observational e study was a National Clinical 2019.

Hospitals in China are classified in a 3-tier svstem (primary, second arvy or tertiary hospital) that recognizes a hospital's ability to provide medical care, medical education, and conduct medical research. Tertiary hospitals, similar to a tertiary referral hospital in the West, are usually comprehen- sive, referral, general hospitals responsible for provid- ing specialist health services, perform a larger role with 1 and scientific research regard to medical education and serve as medical hubs providing care to multiple regions Secondary hospitals, similar to : a regional hospital e district hospital in the West, tend to be affiliated with medium-sized city, county, or district and are responsible for providing comprehensive health services and medical education and conducting research on a regional basis. Ir contrast, primary hospitals are primary health care insti- tutions whose main function is to provide primary pre- vention directly to the population, however, they rarely admit and treat critically ill patients. Therefore, primary hospitals were not included in the scope of the study The enrolled tertiary and secondary hospitals voluntar- ily participated and were selected by the China-NCCOC The selection criteria were as follows. (1) The ICU had to have more than five beds. (2) The ICU had to have the ability to diagnose and treat the relevant medical dis- eases that were evaluated as quality control items (such catheter- ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as related blood stream infections (CRBSIs), and catheter- associated urinary tract",

First., the use of secondary data limited essential variables such as the patient-level characteristics or uncontrolled confound- ers (e.g., education level of the staff. ICU bed occu- pancy rate) needed to understand the predictive factors of the patients' outcomes. To reduce these methodo- logical problems, we applied multivariate analysis using s adjusted for generalized linear mixed models patient disease severity using the APACHE I score, which has been shown to be an important predictor of patient outcomes [29, 30]. Second, since only one year of data was reported, presented and summarized in this study of the structural factors and health the relationships. outcomes could: not be analysed continuously anc dynamically. Third, this was an observational study and therefore, prone to selection bias. Causal relationships cannot be drawn due to the cross-sectional nature of the study design. Fourth, listwise deletion was used to data, which may cause bias in the handle the missing of the parameters 31 . Despite these limi- estimates tations, the results of this study are highly meaning- ful in that they underscore the necessity of nonpatient factors, including hospital and ICU structural factors, addi- as a way to reduce : adverse patient outcomes. In : tion, we have improved the generalizability of the find- ings by using national administrative data, unlike most data previous studies, which were conducted using from only certain regions or hospitals. The results may have important implications for critical care develop ment in China and other countries with similar medica environments.\n\nIn conclusion, specific structural factors, includingl hos- pital ownership, hospital type, I ICU-hospital bed percent: with ICU and bed-to-nurse associated e ratio age, were 1 poli- These observations can patient 1 assist in toutcomes. the cies and interventions bridge current quality gap in the delivery of critical care in China well as other developing countries.\n\nVAP: Ventilator-associated pneumonia; CRBSls: Catheter-related blood stream infections; CAUTls: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections: APACHE I score: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score; IQR: Interquartile range;95% Cl: Confidence interval; ICU: Intensive care unit\n\n### Supplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi. org/10.1186/s13054-022-03892-7.\n\nAdditional fle 1.

        "ground_truth": "Preventive medication, particularly sodium bicarbonate, has shown varying degrees of effectiveness compared to saline solution in preventing contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI). Several studies have been conducted to evaluate this effectiveness. One study by Ozcan et al. found that the incidence of CI-AKI was significantly lower in the bicarbonate group compared to the saline solution group. Another study by Recio-Mayoral et al. observed a lower incidence of CI-AKI in the bicarbonate group compared to the saline group, although mortality and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) did not significantly differ between the groups. Briguori et al. also found a lower incidence of CI-AKI in the bicarbonate/NAC group compared to the saline plus NAC group, but no significant difference was observed in mortality or the need for RRT among different treatment groups. However, a study by Maioli et al. did not find a significant difference in CI-AKI incidence between patients treated with sodium bicarbonate and those treated with saline. Overall, while some studies suggest that sodium bicarbonate may be more effective than saline, particularly when combined with NAC, others do not provide conclusive evidence, indicating that further research is needed to determine the optimal preventive medication for CI-AKI.",

While this heterogeneity provides insight into some susceptibility s populations, the factors that 1 across various are common setting to the generalizability c of results from one particular next is uncertain The course and outcome of AKI are modified by other factors, but since these are manifested within the context of actual disease, they must as\"prognostic' be categorized rather than \"risk\" factors, hence being discussed separately in Appendix D. Lastly, the fact that some 30% of patients whc increased risk of CKD recover from AKI remain cardiovascular disease, and death calls for the identification of the risk factors that can identify such patients in the hopes 50-52 of providing them with timely preventive measures Finally, it screen patients who have is important to undergone an exposure (e.g., sepsis, trauma) and to continue monitor high-risk patients until the risk has subsided. Exact intervals for checking and in which individuals to monitor urine output remain matters of clinical judgment: however, as a general rule, high risk in-patients should have SCr measured at least daily and  more frequently after exposure, and critically ill patients should have urine output monitoring. This will necessitate urinary bladder catheteriza- tion in many cases, and the risks of infection should also be considered in the monitoring plan. A recent clinical practice assessment in the UK concluded that only 50% of patients with AKI were considered to have received a\"good\" overall standard of care. This figure fell to\n\nt over 30% if AKI developed during just hospital admission rather than being diagnosed before admission.53 The authors also felt that there n unacceptable delay in recognizing AKI in 43% that the those condition after developed that in a fifth of such n patients its develop admission, and ment was predictable and avoidable.

            "induced The mechanisms 1 renal 1 injury incompletely understood, but I involve both direct may molecular effects and effects of elevated oncotic pressure These concerns have led to the widespread adoption of lower MW starches as iso-oncotic solution, as resuscitation fluids Theoretically, such solutions may have lower nephrotoxicity o appropriately powered however, prospective yet, randomized studies have reported the clinica benefit : and\n\nKidney International Supplements (2012) 2, 37-68\n\nsafety of such solutions in comparison with 1 crystalloids. A recent study by Magder et al. compared 10% 250/0.45 HES to isotonic c saline in 262 patients ; who underwent cardiac surgery.100 These investigators tested whether fewer patients required Icatecholamines the morning after cardiac surgery (a chief determinant of ICU discharge) with HES compared to saline, and found indeed this the case (10.9% was VS 28.8%: P= 0.001). Importantly, the study found no evidence of nephrotoxicity: no difference in the daily creatinine, deve. lopment of AKI by RIFLE criteria during hospital stay (16% in both groups), or need for RRT (1% in each group) Importantly, patients in the saline group received nearly 60% more volume for fluid resuscitation in the ICU compared to HES (887 ys. 1397 ml: P<0 0001) While overall volume were small, advocates for colloid resuscitation will note that this is exactly the reason colloids are preferred for patients requiring large-volume resuscitation The tonicity of colloid preparations may also vary by t meta-analysis described 11 randomized agent. A recent trials s with a total of 1220 patients: seven evaluating albumin and hyperoncotic four evaluating hyperoncotie starch. Hyperoncotic albumin decreased the odds of AKI by 76% while hyperoncotic starch increased those odds by 92% (odds ratio [OR] 1,92: CI 1.31-2.81: P= 0.0008). Paralle effects on mortality were observed. This meta-analysis con cluded that the renal effects of hyperoncotic colloid solution appear to be colloid-specific, with displaying  albumin renoprotection and hyperoncotic starch showing nephro- toxicity. A 7000-patient study comparing 6% HES 130/0.4 in saline with saline alone was scheduled to begin in Australia and New Zealand in 2010. This study will provide further high-quality data to help guide clinical practice 102 Thus, the use of isotonic saline as the standard of care for intravascular volume expansion to prevent or treat AKl is based upon the lack of clear evidence that colloids s are superior for this purpose, along  with some evidence that specifc colloids may cause Akl, in addition to hgher costs. T is acknowledged that colloids may be chosen in some patient: to aid in reaching resuscitation goals, or to avoid excessive fluid administration in patients requiring  volume g large resuscitation, or in specific patient subsets (e.g., a cirrhotic patient with spontaneous peritonitis, or in burns). Similarly although hypotonic or hypertonic crystalloids may be used in specific clinical the choice of crystalloic with scenarios, altered tonicity is generally dictated by: goals other than intravascular volume or expansion (e.g., hypernatremia nyponatremia). One of the concerns with isotonic saline is that this contains 154 mmol/l chloride and  that solution administration in large volumes s will result in relative 01 absolute hyperchloremia (for a review, see Kaplan et al.103) Although direct proof of harm arising from saline-induced hyperchloremia is lacking, buffered salt solutions approxi mate physiological chloride concentrations and their admin istration  less likely to acid-base disturbances cause Whether use of buffered solutions results in better outcome: is, however, uncertain\n\n### VASOPRESSORS\n\n3.1.2: We recommend the use of vasopressors in conjunc- tion with fluids in patients with vasomotor shock with, or at risk for, AKI.

            "\n\n### E Grade\n\nRationale. When a glycemic control strat- egy is initiated, hypoglycemia is minimized by providing a continuous supply of glucose sub- patient is Initially, unless the s already strate. profoundly hyperglycemia, this is accom- plished with 5% or 10% dextrose infusion and followed by initiation of feeding, preferably by the enteral route, if tolerated (97).\n\n### N. Renal Replacement\n\n1. In acute renal failure,: and in the absence of hemodynamic instability, continuous venovenous hemofiltration 1 and intermit tent hemodialysis are considered equiva- lent. Continuous hemofiltration offers eas-\n\nB Grade\n\nRationale. Studies support the equivalence of continuous and intermittent renal replace- ment therapies for the treatment of acute re nal failure in critically ill patients (98, 99).In hemodialysis termittent poorly may be hemodynamically tolerated  unstable pa- tients. There is no current evidence to support the use of continuous venovenous hemofiltra- tion for the treatment of sepsis independent of renal replacement needs.\n\n### O. Bicarbonate Therapy\n\n1. Bicarbonate of therapy for the purpose hemodynamics reducing improving vasopressor requirements is not recom- mended for treatment of hypoperfusion- induced lactic acidemia with pH ≥7.15. The effect of bicarbonate administration hemodynamics on and re- vasopressor pH as well s the at lower quirement effect on clinical outcome at any pH has not been studied\n\nRationale There is no evidence to support the use of bicarbonate the treat- therapy in hypoperfusion-induced acidemia as- ment sociated with sepsis. Two studies comparing pH saline and bicarbonate in patients with ≥7.13-7.15 failed to reveal any difference in hemodynamic variables or re- r vasopressor quirements between equimolar  concentra- e with tions of bicarbonate and normal saline either therapy (100, 101).\n\n### P. Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis\n\n1. Severe patients should sepsis recerve deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with either low-dose unfractionated hep- arin low-molecular r weight heparin For septic patients who have a contrain- dication for heparin I use (i.e., thrombo- active cvtopenia. coagulopathy, severe bleeding. intracerebral hemor: recent rhage), the use of a mechanical prophy- device (graduated lactic compression intermittent stockings compression device) is recommended (unless contra- indicated l the of peripheral presence disease).l vascular very high-risk In pa tients such those who o have severe sepsis and history of DVT, a combination of pharmacologic : and mechanical ther- apy is recommended.\n\n### Grade\n\nRationale. Although no study s been has performed specifically in patients with severe of benefit sepsis, large trials confirming the DVT1 prophvlaxis in general ICU populations have included significant septic numbers patients (102-104). This benefit should be ap-\n\nment of intravascular support (110). On the basis of a number of studies, it is accepted tha aggressive fluid resuscitation with crvstalloid colloids is of fundamental importance to survival of septic shock in children (111. 112) There is only one randomized, controlled tria comparing the use of colloid to crvstalloic resuscitation (dextran gelatin, lactated Ring er's solution, or saline) in children with den gue shock (111) All these children survived regardless of the fluid used but the longes time to recovery from shock occurred in chil dren who received lactated Ringer's solution Among patients with the narrowest pulse pres sure there was a suggestion that colloids wer effective than crvstalloids in restorins more normal pulse pressure Fluid infusion is bes initiated with boluses of 20 mL /ks over 5-10 mins titrated to clinical monitors of cardiae output including heart rate urine outnut capillary refill I and level of consciousness Children normally have a lower blood pressure than adults and prevent reduction in blood pressure by vasoconstrictior and in creasing heart rate Therefore blood pressu by itself is not a reliable end point for assess ing the adequacy of resuscitation, However once hvpotension occurs. cardiovascular col lanse may soon follow Henatomegaly occurs in children who are fluid overloaded and car be a helpful sign of the adequacy of fluic resuscitation."

        "answer": "1. Fluid challenge is a term used to describe the initial volume expansion period in which the response of the patient to fluid administration is carefully evaluated. It involves administering a specific amount of fluids, typically in the form of crystalloids or colloids, over a short period, usually 30 minutes, to assess the patient's response and avoid the development of edema. The goal is to detect inadequate arterial circulation and guide fluid resuscitation accordingly.",

During this process, large amounts of fluids may be administered over a short period under close monitoring to evaluate the patient's response and avoid the development of edema. In the management of acute sepsis, fluid challenge helps in assessing the patient's response to fluid administration and guides further fluid resuscitation. It is crucial for evaluating the patient's hemodynamic status and ensuring adequate perfusion, especially during the first 24 hours of management when aggressive fluid resuscitation is often necessary. Input/output ratios are not useful during this period. Instead, the focus is on closely monitoring the patient's response to fluid administration to maintain adequate perfusion and prevent complications such as pulmonary edema.",

Studies support the equivalence of continuous and intermittent renal replace- ment therapies for the treatment of acute re nal failure in critically ill patients (98, 99).In hemodialysis termittent poorly may be hemodynamically tolerated  unstable pa- tients. There is no current evidence to support the use of continuous venovenous hemofiltra- tion for the treatment of sepsis independent of renal replacement needs.\n\n### O. Bicarbonate Therapy\n\n1. Bicarbonate of therapy for the purpose hemodynamics reducing improving vasopressor requirements is not recom- mended for treatment of hypoperfusion- induced lactic acidemia with pH ≥7.15. The effect of bicarbonate administration hemodynamics on and re- vasopressor pH as well s the at lower quirement effect on clinical outcome at any pH has not been studied\n\nRationale There is no evidence to support the use of bicarbonate the treat- therapy in hypoperfusion-induced acidemia as- ment sociated with sepsis.

This benefit should be ap-\n\nment of intravascular support (110). On the basis of a number of studies, it is accepted tha aggressive fluid resuscitation with crvstalloid colloids is of fundamental importance to survival of septic shock in children (111. 112) There is only one randomized, controlled tria comparing the use of colloid to crvstalloic resuscitation (dextran gelatin, lactated Ring er's solution, or saline) in children with den gue shock (111) All these children survived regardless of the fluid used but the longes time to recovery from shock occurred in chil dren who received lactated Ringer's solution Among patients with the narrowest pulse pres sure there was a suggestion that colloids wer effective than crvstalloids in restorins more normal pulse pressure Fluid infusion is bes initiated with boluses of 20 mL /ks over 5-10 mins titrated to clinical monitors of cardiae output including heart rate urine outnut capillary refill I and level of consciousness Children normally have a lower blood pressure than adults and prevent reduction in blood pressure by vasoconstrictior and in creasing heart rate Therefore blood pressu by itself is not a reliable end point for assess ing the adequacy of resuscitation, However once hvpotension occurs. cardiovascular col lanse may soon follow Henatomegaly occurs in children who are fluid overloaded and car be a helpful sign of the adequacy of fluic resuscitation.",

Although the clinical significance is not clear, it is now recognized that etomidate, when used for induction for intubation, will suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis [185. 186]. Moreover, a  subanalysis of the CORTICUS trial [178] revealed that the use of etomidate before application of low-dose steroids was associated with an increased 28-day [187].

Several factors, including ICU struc ture, ICU organization and d the care process, can influ ence ICU 1 extensive performance 1-3]. Despite the ICUs, the the quality of care literature addressing impact of such factors remains controversial, and a dili. gent assessment of care components is required It is well known that ICU structural factors vary within and regions [4, 51. However, most different countries related conducted in Western studies have been coun- tries [6. 71. Little evidence regarding the structural factors of ICUs in China is available [81, China still faces chal lenges in providing optimal and equitable management strategies for ICU patients across the nation because its broad geography and unbalanced economic develop ment. A previous study described critical care resources in Guangdong Province 9. Another study evaluated the practices, outcomes, and costs related to mechanical ven: tilation within ICUs in Beijing [10]. Nonetheless, those studies were limited to the regions in which the surveys were administered and feature small e sizes: it is I sample also not clear whether those resources were e associated with ICU care provision, treatment patterns, and patient demands outcomes. Finally, increasing  and I rising costs significant challenges to the delivery of high-qual pose: ity and affordable critical care to a growing population of patients. Optimizing ICU organization is a potentia opportunity to improve patient outcomes and the use of resources. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate hos- pital and ICU structural factors and patient outcomes in China. Moreover, we aimed to identify the associa- tion between these variables and patient outcomes, with structural factors, including ICU a focus on potential structural resources and staffing levels. We hypothesized that patients admitted to hospitals that were government- funded, tertiary, well-equipped, and better-staffed woulc have a decreased risk of ICU mortality and occurrence of VAP, CRBSIs and CAUTIs after adjusting for region, dis ease severity, and other confounders.\n\nDesign This nationwide, database observational e study was a National Clinical 2019.

Hospitals in China are classified in a 3-tier svstem (primary, second arvy or tertiary hospital) that recognizes a hospital's ability to provide medical care, medical education, and conduct medical research. Tertiary hospitals, similar to a tertiary referral hospital in the West, are usually comprehen- sive, referral, general hospitals responsible for provid- ing specialist health services, perform a larger role with 1 and scientific research regard to medical education and serve as medical hubs providing care to multiple regions Secondary hospitals, similar to : a regional hospital e district hospital in the West, tend to be affiliated with medium-sized city, county, or district and are responsible for providing comprehensive health services and medical education and conducting research on a regional basis. Ir contrast, primary hospitals are primary health care insti- tutions whose main function is to provide primary pre- vention directly to the population, however, they rarely admit and treat critically ill patients. Therefore, primary hospitals were not included in the scope of the study The enrolled tertiary and secondary hospitals voluntar- ily participated and were selected by the China-NCCOC The selection criteria were as follows. (1) The ICU had to have more than five beds. (2) The ICU had to have the ability to diagnose and treat the relevant medical dis- eases that were evaluated as quality control items (such catheter- ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as related blood stream infections (CRBSIs), and catheter- associated urinary tract",

Sifa Gao2t Qi Li, Hongbo Luo , Jianhua Sun',Wei Du', Longxiang Su', Lu Wang Qing Zhang', Zunzhu Lil\"*, Xiang Zhou\" and Dawei Liu\" on behalf of China National Critical Care Quality Control Center Group\n\nBackground: Hospital and CU structural factors are key factors affecting the guality of care as well as CU patient outcomes. However, the data from China are scarce. This study was designed to investigate how differences in patient outcomes are associated with differences in hospital and ICU structure variables in China throughout 2019\n\nMethods: This was a multicenter observational study. Data from a total of 2820 hospitals were collected using the National Clinical lmprovement System Data that reports CU information in China. Data collection consisted of al information on the hospital and ICU structural factors, including the hospital type, number of beds, staffng, among others, and b) ICU patient outcomes, including the mortality rate as well as the incidence of ventilator-associated oneumonia (VAP). catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02%(3.78%, 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP CRBSL, and CAUT\n\npneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02% (3.78%., 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP. CRBSL, and CAUT were 5.58 (1.55.11.67) per 1000 ventilator davs., 0.63 (0.2.01) per 1000 catheter davs,and 142 (0.37,3,40) per 1000 catheter davs, respectively. Mortality was sianificantly lower in public hospitals (B= -0.018(- 0031.- 0.005) p=0.006), hospitals with an ICU-to-hospital bed percentage of more than 2% (B= -0.027 (-0.034,-0.019)., p<0.001) and higber in hospitals with a bed-to-nurse ratio of more than 0 5:1 (B=0009 (0 001 0017) np=0 027) The incidence of VAP was lower in public hospitals (B= -0.036 (- 0.054.-0018), p<0.001). The incidence of CRBSls was lower in public hospitals (B= -0.008 (- 0.014,-0002), p=0.011) and hiaher in secondary hospitals (B=0.005 (0.001.,0.009) p= 0.010), while the incidence of CAUTls was higher in secondary hospitals (B=0.010 (0002. 0.018)., p= 0.015)\n\ndwliu98@163.com [Zhen Li, Xudong Ma and Sifa Gao contributed equally to this work 'Department of Critical Care Medicine.

It is strongly recommended to set the platform pressure upper limit at 30cmH2O, which is based on moderate-quality evidence. This recommendation aims to prevent barotrauma and minimize lung injury in ARDS patients. Additionally, for patients with moderate to severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ≤200mmHg), it is suggested to use higher levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), albeit weakly recommended and supported by moderate-quality evidence.

            " more advanced study. needed design and analytical approach examine the dynamic impact of nurse staffing on ICU patient outcomes There are some limitations to this study. First., the use of secondary data limited essential variables such as the patient-level characteristics or uncontrolled confound- ers (e.g., education level of the staff. ICU bed occu- pancy rate) needed to understand the predictive factors of the patients' outcomes. To reduce these methodo- logical problems, we applied multivariate analysis using s adjusted for generalized linear mixed models patient disease severity using the APACHE I score, which has been shown to be an important predictor of patient outcomes [29, 30]. Second, since only one year of data was reported, presented and summarized in this study of the structural factors and health the relationships. outcomes could: not be analysed continuously anc dynamically. Third, this was an observational study and therefore, prone to selection bias. Causal relationships cannot be drawn due to the cross-sectional nature of the study design. Fourth, listwise deletion was used to data, which may cause bias in the handle the missing of the parameters 31 . Despite these limi- estimates tations, the results of this study are highly meaning- ful in that they underscore the necessity of nonpatient factors, including hospital and ICU structural factors, addi- as a way to reduce : adverse patient outcomes. In : tion, we have improved the generalizability of the find- ings by using national administrative data, unlike most data previous studies, which were conducted using from only certain regions or hospitals. The results may have important implications for critical care develop ment in China and other countries with similar medica environments.\n\nIn conclusion, specific structural factors, includingl hos- pital ownership, hospital type, I ICU-hospital bed percent: with ICU and bed-to-nurse associated e ratio age, were 1 poli- These observations can patient 1 assist in toutcomes. the cies and interventions bridge current quality gap in the delivery of critical care in China well as other developing countries.\n\nVAP: Ventilator-associated pneumonia; CRBSls: Catheter-related blood stream infections; CAUTls: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections: APACHE I score: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score; IQR: Interquartile range;95% Cl: Confidence interval; ICU: Intensive care unit\n\n### Supplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi. org/10.1186/s13054-022-03892-7.\n\nAdditional fle 1.

Several factors, including ICU struc ture, ICU organization and d the care process, can influ ence ICU 1 extensive performance 1-3]. Despite the ICUs, the the quality of care literature addressing impact of such factors remains controversial, and a dili. gent assessment of care components is required It is well known that ICU structural factors vary within and regions [4, 51. However, most different countries related conducted in Western studies have been coun- tries [6. 71. Little evidence regarding the structural factors of ICUs in China is available [81, China still faces chal lenges in providing optimal and equitable management strategies for ICU patients across the nation because its broad geography and unbalanced economic develop ment. A previous study described critical care resources in Guangdong Province 9. Another study evaluated the practices, outcomes, and costs related to mechanical ven: tilation within ICUs in Beijing [10]. Nonetheless, those studies were limited to the regions in which the surveys were administered and feature small e sizes: it is I sample also not clear whether those resources were e associated with ICU care provision, treatment patterns, and patient demands outcomes. Finally, increasing  and I rising costs significant challenges to the delivery of high-qual pose: ity and affordable critical care to a growing population of patients. Optimizing ICU organization is a potentia opportunity to improve patient outcomes and the use of resources. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate hos- pital and ICU structural factors and patient outcomes in China. Moreover, we aimed to identify the associa- tion between these variables and patient outcomes, with structural factors, including ICU a focus on potential structural resources and staffing levels. We hypothesized that patients admitted to hospitals that were government- funded, tertiary, well-equipped, and better-staffed woulc have a decreased risk of ICU mortality and occurrence of VAP, CRBSIs and CAUTIs after adjusting for region, dis ease severity, and other confounders.\n\nDesign This nationwide, database observational e study was a National Clinical 2019.

Hospitals in China are classified in a 3-tier svstem (primary, second arvy or tertiary hospital) that recognizes a hospital's ability to provide medical care, medical education, and conduct medical research. Tertiary hospitals, similar to a tertiary referral hospital in the West, are usually comprehen- sive, referral, general hospitals responsible for provid- ing specialist health services, perform a larger role with 1 and scientific research regard to medical education and serve as medical hubs providing care to multiple regions Secondary hospitals, similar to : a regional hospital e district hospital in the West, tend to be affiliated with medium-sized city, county, or district and are responsible for providing comprehensive health services and medical education and conducting research on a regional basis. Ir contrast, primary hospitals are primary health care insti- tutions whose main function is to provide primary pre- vention directly to the population, however, they rarely admit and treat critically ill patients. Therefore, primary hospitals were not included in the scope of the study The enrolled tertiary and secondary hospitals voluntar- ily participated and were selected by the China-NCCOC The selection criteria were as follows. (1) The ICU had to have more than five beds. (2) The ICU had to have the ability to diagnose and treat the relevant medical dis- eases that were evaluated as quality control items (such catheter- ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as related blood stream infections (CRBSIs), and catheter- associated urinary tract",

First., the use of secondary data limited essential variables such as the patient-level characteristics or uncontrolled confound- ers (e.g., education level of the staff.

To reduce these methodo- logical problems, we applied multivariate analysis using s adjusted for generalized linear mixed models patient disease severity using the APACHE I score, which has been shown to be an important predictor of patient outcomes [29, 30]. Second, since only one year of data was reported, presented and summarized in this study of the structural factors and health the relationships. outcomes could: not be analysed continuously anc dynamically. Third, this was an observational study and therefore, prone to selection bias. Causal relationships cannot be drawn due to the cross-sectional nature of the study design. Fourth, listwise deletion was used to data, which may cause bias in the handle the missing of the parameters 31 .

Several factors, including ICU struc ture, ICU organization and d the care process, can influ ence ICU 1 extensive performance 1-3]. Despite the ICUs, the the quality of care literature addressing impact of such factors remains controversial, and a dili. gent assessment of care components is required It is well known that ICU structural factors vary within and regions [4, 51. However, most different countries related conducted in Western studies have been coun- tries [6. 71. Little evidence regarding the structural factors of ICUs in China is available [81, China still faces chal lenges in providing optimal and equitable management strategies for ICU patients across the nation because its broad geography and unbalanced economic develop ment. A previous study described critical care resources in Guangdong Province 9. Another study evaluated the practices, outcomes, and costs related to mechanical ven: tilation within ICUs in Beijing [10]. Nonetheless, those studies were limited to the regions in which the surveys were administered and feature small e sizes: it is I sample also not clear whether those resources were e associated with ICU care provision, treatment patterns, and patient demands outcomes. Finally, increasing  and I rising costs significant challenges to the delivery of high-qual pose: ity and affordable critical care to a growing population of patients. Optimizing ICU organization is a potentia opportunity to improve patient outcomes and the use of resources. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate hos- pital and ICU structural factors and patient outcomes in China. Moreover, we aimed to identify the associa- tion between these variables and patient outcomes, with structural factors, including ICU a focus on potential structural resources and staffing levels. We hypothesized that patients admitted to hospitals that were government- funded, tertiary, well-equipped, and better-staffed woulc have a decreased risk of ICU mortality and occurrence of VAP, CRBSIs and CAUTIs after adjusting for region, dis ease severity, and other confounders.\n\nDesign This nationwide, database observational e study was a National Clinical 2019.

Hospitals in China are classified in a 3-tier svstem (primary, second arvy or tertiary hospital) that recognizes a hospital's ability to provide medical care, medical education, and conduct medical research. Tertiary hospitals, similar to a tertiary referral hospital in the West, are usually comprehen- sive, referral, general hospitals responsible for provid- ing specialist health services, perform a larger role with 1 and scientific research regard to medical education and serve as medical hubs providing care to multiple regions Secondary hospitals, similar to : a regional hospital e district hospital in the West, tend to be affiliated with medium-sized city, county, or district and are responsible for providing comprehensive health services and medical education and conducting research on a regional basis. Ir contrast, primary hospitals are primary health care insti- tutions whose main function is to provide primary pre- vention directly to the population, however, they rarely admit and treat critically ill patients. Therefore, primary hospitals were not included in the scope of the study The enrolled tertiary and secondary hospitals voluntar- ily participated and were selected by the China-NCCOC The selection criteria were as follows. (1) The ICU had to have more than five beds. (2) The ICU had to have the ability to diagnose and treat the relevant medical dis- eases that were evaluated as quality control items (such catheter- ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as related blood stream infections (CRBSIs), and catheter- associated urinary tract",

However, the data from China are scarce. This study was designed to investigate how differences in patient outcomes are associated with differences in hospital and ICU structure variables in China throughout 2019\n\nMethods: This was a multicenter observational study. Data from a total of 2820 hospitals were collected using the National Clinical lmprovement System Data that reports CU information in China. Data collection consisted of al information on the hospital and ICU structural factors, including the hospital type, number of beds, staffng, among others, and b) ICU patient outcomes, including the mortality rate as well as the incidence of ventilator-associated oneumonia (VAP). catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02%(3.78%, 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP CRBSL, and CAUT\n\npneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02% (3.78%., 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP. CRBSL, and CAUT were 5.58 (1.55.11.67) per 1000 ventilator davs., 0.63 (0.2.01) per 1000 catheter davs,and 142 (0.37,3,40) per 1000 catheter davs, respectively. Mortality was sianificantly lower in public hospitals (B= -0.018(- 0031.- 0.005) p=0.006), hospitals with an ICU-to-hospital bed percentage of more than 2% (B= -0.027 (-0.034,-0.019)., p<0.001) and higber in hospitals with a bed-to-nurse ratio of more than 0 5:1 (B=0009 (0 001 0017) np=0 027) The incidence of VAP was lower in public hospitals (B= -0.036 (- 0.054.-0018), p<0.001).

Sifa Gao2t Qi Li, Hongbo Luo , Jianhua Sun',Wei Du', Longxiang Su', Lu Wang Qing Zhang', Zunzhu Lil\"*, Xiang Zhou\" and Dawei Liu\" on behalf of China National Critical Care Quality Control Center Group\n\nBackground: Hospital and CU structural factors are key factors affecting the guality of care as well as CU patient outcomes. However, the data from China are scarce. This study was designed to investigate how differences in patient outcomes are associated with differences in hospital and ICU structure variables in China throughout 2019\n\nMethods: This was a multicenter observational study. Data from a total of 2820 hospitals were collected using the National Clinical lmprovement System Data that reports CU information in China. Data collection consisted of al information on the hospital and ICU structural factors, including the hospital type, number of beds, staffng, among others, and b) ICU patient outcomes, including the mortality rate as well as the incidence of ventilator-associated oneumonia (VAP). catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02%(3.78%, 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP CRBSL, and CAUT\n\npneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02% (3.78%., 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP.

Several factors, including ICU struc ture, ICU organization and d the care process, can influ ence ICU 1 extensive performance 1-3]. Despite the ICUs, the the quality of care literature addressing impact of such factors remains controversial, and a dili. gent assessment of care components is required It is well known that ICU structural factors vary within and regions [4, 51. However, most different countries related conducted in Western studies have been coun- tries [6. 71. Little evidence regarding the structural factors of ICUs in China is available [81, China still faces chal lenges in providing optimal and equitable management strategies for ICU patients across the nation because its broad geography and unbalanced economic develop ment. A previous study described critical care resources in Guangdong Province 9. Another study evaluated the practices, outcomes, and costs related to mechanical ven: tilation within ICUs in Beijing [10]. Nonetheless, those studies were limited to the regions in which the surveys were administered and feature small e sizes: it is I sample also not clear whether those resources were e associated with ICU care provision, treatment patterns, and patient demands outcomes. Finally, increasing  and I rising costs significant challenges to the delivery of high-qual pose: ity and affordable critical care to a growing population of patients. Optimizing ICU organization is a potentia opportunity to improve patient outcomes and the use of resources. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate hos- pital and ICU structural factors and patient outcomes in China. Moreover, we aimed to identify the associa- tion between these variables and patient outcomes, with structural factors, including ICU a focus on potential structural resources and staffing levels. We hypothesized that patients admitted to hospitals that were government- funded, tertiary, well-equipped, and better-staffed woulc have a decreased risk of ICU mortality and occurrence of VAP, CRBSIs and CAUTIs after adjusting for region, dis ease severity, and other confounders.\n\nDesign This nationwide, database observational e study was a National Clinical 2019.

Hospitals in China are classified in a 3-tier svstem (primary, second arvy or tertiary hospital) that recognizes a hospital's ability to provide medical care, medical education, and conduct medical research. Tertiary hospitals, similar to a tertiary referral hospital in the West, are usually comprehen- sive, referral, general hospitals responsible for provid- ing specialist health services, perform a larger role with 1 and scientific research regard to medical education and serve as medical hubs providing care to multiple regions Secondary hospitals, similar to : a regional hospital e district hospital in the West, tend to be affiliated with medium-sized city, county, or district and are responsible for providing comprehensive health services and medical education and conducting research on a regional basis.

            "When selecting a vein for insertion dialysis in patients with AKI, the preference for catheter placement would be: First choice: left jugular vein; Second choice: femoral vein; Third choice: right jugular vein; Last choice: subclavian vein with preference for the non-dominant side.\n\nAlthough generally associated with the lowest rate of infectious complications, the CDC guideline as well as the KDOQI guideline recommend avoiding the right jugular vein for RRT access. This recommendation is mainly derived from observational data in ESRD patients showing a higher incidence of central vein stenosis with right jugular than with subclavian dialysis catheters. On the other hand, central vein stenosis has also been described after subclavian catheterization. The contact of the catheter with the vessel wall is considered a primary initiating event for catheter-related thrombosis and stenosis. Catheters in the left internal jugular vein have a straight course into the left brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava, and, therefore, the least contact with the vessel wall. A catheter inserted through the right subclavian or the right jugular vein has one or more angulations, explaining the higher risk of vessel contact and thrombosis/stenosis with right-sided compared to left jugular catheters. The right jugular vein should, therefore, be considered the last choice for insertion of a dialysis catheter in patients with AKI, especially when the risk of nonrecovery of kidney function is substantial. Whether this recommendation should be extended to the right jugular vein remains unclear. In patients where the right jugular vein remains the only available option, preference should be given to the non-dominant side in order to spare the dominant side for eventual future permanent access. Because the right jugular vein should be avoided, the remaining options are the left jugular and femoral veins. The use of femoral catheters is thought to be associated with the highest risk of infection, and avoidance of femoral lines is part of many \"central line bundles\" that intend to reduce the incidence of bloodstream catheter-related infections. This dogma was questioned in a concealed, randomized multicenter, evaluator-blinded, parallel-group trial of 750 AKI patients, comparing the femoral with the left jugular site for first catheter insertion for RRT. Ultrasound was seldom used probably explaining the somewhat higher rate of failure on one side and crossover in the left jugular group. The rate of hematoma formation was also higher in the left jugular group. In both groups, 20% of the catheters were impregnated with antiseptic. The mean duration of catheterization was 6.2 days for the femoral and 6.9 days for the left jugular group. The major reasons for catheter removal were no longer required or death. The incidence of catheter colonization at removal did not significantly differ between the femoral and left jugular group. When stratified according to body mass index (BMI), those within the lowest BMI tertile had a higher incidence of colonization with the left jugular site, whereas those within the highest BMI tertile had the highest colonization rate with femoral catheters. Bloodstream infection did not differ between the groups (2.3 per 1000 catheter-days for left jugular and 1.5 per 1000 catheter-days for femoral) but the study was not powered for this point. This was also the case for thrombotic complications. Malfunction is another issue that needs to be considered when choosing between left jugular and femoral access. Observational trials show more malfunctioning and a shorter actuarial survival for femoral than for left jugular dialysis."

The supplement submission wil include background material, questions posed that led to the recommendation, and expanded rationale. This executive summary is targeted to be concise and user friendly for the bedside clinician, The 2001 publication that was s used as a starting point for current : process included a MEDLINE search for clinical trials in the preceding 10 vrs. supplemented by manual search of other relevant journals, Sub topics for each recommendation were cross referenced to sepsis, septic sepsis, severe shock. sepsis syndrome, and infection. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines consid ered the in the 2001 evidence 1 publication (through 1999) and repeated the process for 2000 through 2003. The committee process began in June 2003 with a meeting featuring the first presentations of data and recommen dations. Recommendations discussed were and critiqued. Each clinical trial used to sup port recommendations was graded based lor the methodology in Table 1 and included pres- ence or absence of important elements such as concealed randomization, blinded outcome adjudication, intention to treat analysis, and explicit definition of primary outcome. All ar- v reviewed ticles were initially based on sub- group assignments and d typically by  two on three participants. Survival (28-30 days) was the standard outcome measure used to assess outcome benefit, and when an alternative was used this is the rationale. Where $ stated in strong trial evidence existed for outcome ben- efit in critically ill populations known to con tain a larger number of sepsis patients, these trials were considered in determination of rec ommendation grading. A strict evidence-based methodology with a scoring system was\n\nused. The goal was total consensus, which wa: reached in all recommendations except two. In those circumstances (recommendations C3 ang H1), the solution was achieved with the inclu subrecommendations that expressed some difference in expert opinion, When there difference of opinion was 1about grading clinical trial, an outside epidemiologist was con sulted This occurred in one circumstance with resolution of differences. Each participant com pleted a conflict of interest form, and individual: were not assigned to a subgroup topic if they had a potential conflict of interest. A full listing of al potential conflicts of interest is included with this article. Following that meeting. the process continued with o further refinement t of recom mendations through electronic communicatior among committee members. A second meeting of core members of the committee occurred inr early October 2003. The document was finalized and approved by the consensus committee and by sponsoring organizations in December 2003 Evidence-based anproaches more readily applied to data from therapeutic trials 1 of diagnostic techniques is less Evaluation well suited to this approach. Readers will note that the maiority of the recommendations ar nof supported by high-level evidence. Most are supported by expert opinion only.

Methods: We used a modified Delphi methodology for grading recommendations. built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.\n\nKey recommendations, listed by category and not by Results: K hierarchy, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition; appropriate diagnostic studies to ascertain causative organisms before starting antibiotics: early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy: reassess ment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to a usual 7-10 days of antibiotic narrow coverage, when appropriate; therapy guided by clinical response; source control with attention to the method that balances risks and benefits: equivalence of crystal loid and colloid resuscitation; aggressive fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure; vasopressor preference for norepi- nephrine and dopamine; cautious use of vasopressin pending further studies: avoiding low-dose dopamine administration for renal protec- tion; consideration of dobutamine inotropic therapy in some clinical situations; avoidance of supranormal oxygen delivery as a goal of therapy; stress-dose steroid therapy for septic shock; use of recom- binant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and high risk\n\nfor death: with resolution of tissue hypoperfusion and in the absence of coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage, targeting a hemoglobin of 7-9 a/dL: appropriate use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets; a low tidal volume and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome: application of ressure in acute lung a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory nr distress svndrome: a semirecumbent bed posi- iniurv/acute respiratory r tion unless contraindicated: protocols for weaning and sedation/analge sia. using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion dation with daily interruptions/lightening: avoidance of neuromuscular <150mg/dl blockers. if at all possible: maintenance of blood glucose after initial stabilization: equivalence of continuous veno-veno hemofil- tration and intermittent hemodialysis: lack of utility of bicarbonate use for pH ≥7.15: use of deep vein thrombosis/stress ulcer prophylaxis; and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate. Pediatric con- siderations included a more likely need for intubation due to low func tional residual capacity; more difficult intravenous access: fluid resus citation based on weight with 40-60 mL/kg or higher needed; decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance as the most common hemodynamic profile; greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points: unsettled issue of high-dose steroids for therapy with aggressive of septic shock: and greater risk of hypoglycemia qlucose control. Conclusion: Evidence-based recommendations can be made re garding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that are hoped to translate into improved outcomes for critically ill patient.

        "question": "How does protocolized sedation influence mechanical ventilation duration and hospital stay in sepsis patients? How does neuromuscular blockade usage impact this outcome, considering risks associated with prolonged blockade and the role of glycemic control in severe sepsis management?",
        "answer": "1. Protocolized sedation, when used in critically ill mechanically ventilated sepsis patients, has been shown to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay. This is because sedation protocols often include specific titration endpoints and minimize the use of sedation, which can contribute to the shorter stays.\n\n2. The use of neuromuscular blockers (NMBAs) in septic patients is generally avoided due to the risk of prolonged neuromuscular blockade following discontinuation. If NMBAs are necessary, intermittent bolus administration or continuous infusion with train-of-four monitoring is recommended to minimize the risk and ensure reversal of the block.\n\n3. In the context of severe sepsis management, glycemic control is crucial. Maintaining blood glucose levels between 80-110 mg/dL (4.4-6.1 mmol/L) has been associated with improved survival, and a strategy that includes the enteral route for nutrition is preferred. While high glucose levels may reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, the control of blood glucose concentration appears to be more important than the amount of insulin, and frequent monitoring is necessary.\n\nThe combination of these factors can contribute to the patient's outcome by minimizing the impact of sedation and",

While studies limiting sedation have been performed in a wide range of critically ill patients. there is little reason to assume that septic patients will not derive benefit from this approach [3051. The use of protocols for sedation is one method to limit sedation use. and a randomized controlled clinical trial found that protocolized sedatior compared with usual care reduced duration of mechanica ventilation, lengths of stay, and tracheostomy rates [3051 Avoidance of sedation  strategy.

In o studies have been published that specifically addition. no address the use of NMBAs in septic patients The most common indication for NMBA use in the ICU is to facilitate mechanical ventilation [3141.

Only one prospective RCT has compared peripheral nerve stimulation and standard clinical assessment in ICU patients [323]. Rudis et al. randomized 77 critically ill CU patients requiring neuromuscular blockade to receive dosing of vecuronium based on train-of-four stimulation clinical assessment (control group). The peripheral nerve stimulation group received less drug and recovered neuromuscular function and spontaneous ventilation fas- ter than the control group. Nonrandomized observationa studies have suggested that peripheral nerve monitoring effect clinical recovery from reduces or has no in the ICU [324, 325] NMBAs Benefits to neuromuscular monitoring, including faster recovery of neuromuscular function and shorter intuba- tion times, appear to exist.

While studies limiting sedation have been performed in a wide range of critically ill patients. there is little reason to assume that septic patients will not derive benefit from this approach [3051. The use of protocols for sedation is one method to limit sedation use. and a randomized controlled clinical trial found that protocolized sedatior compared with usual care reduced duration of mechanica ventilation, lengths of stay, and tracheostomy rates [3051 Avoidance of sedation  strategy.

Patients receiving neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) mus be individually assessed regarding discontinuation sedative drugs because the neuromuscular blockade must first be reversed.

        "ground_truth": "Protocolized sedation in sepsis patients has been shown to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation, lengths of stay in the ICU, and hospital lengths of stay. Neuromuscular blockade (NMBAs) usage in this population must be carefully considered due to associated risks, including myopathies and neuropathies. While NMBAs may facilitate mechanical ventilation by improving chest wall compliance and preventing respiratory dyssynchrony, their role in reducing mortality or major morbidity in septic patients is not well-defined. Studies have indicated potential benefits of NMBAs, such as improved oxygen delivery and consumption, but the optimal usage remains uncertain. It's clinically prudent to administer NMBAs only when there is a clear indication that cannot be safely achieved with sedation and analgesia alone. Glycemic control is crucial in severe sepsis management, but its specific interaction with neuromuscular blockade usage and its impact on outcomes in sepsis patients require further investigation.",

They categorize AKI severity into stages based on changes in serum creatinine (SCr) levels and urine output. These criteria have significant implications for clinical practice and patient outcomes according to KDIGO guidelines. They aid in early detection and potential prevention of AKI, which is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). The approach incorporates evidence-based methods by systematically summarizing scientific literature, selecting key topics for review, and conducting rigorous evidence selection, appraisal, and presentation.

We were to review medical records of 21,191 admissions (94.0%). The reasons for not reviewing the rest 1,361 cases included missing medical records (n = 277) and rejection of application by the hospital (n = 1,084).

A total of 988 pathogens were isolated from 646 patients (37.6%) with sepsis, including 765 Gram-negative bacilli a and 178 Gram- positive cocci. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n= 237) was the most common isolated pathogen, followed by Acinetobacter bau- i (n = 183), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 91), Escherichia mannii coli (n = 86), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus n = 70) (Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/C542).\n\nAmong patients, with sepsis, 265 (15.4%) were diagnosed sepsis, whereas 233 patients (13.6%) met criteria for as severe c shock, The median SOFA score at the diagnosis of sep- septic was 2 (IOR, 0-3), 4 (IOR and septic shock severe sepsis, 3-6), and 9 (IQR, 7-11), respectively. However, only 237 patients (13.8%) were admitted into ICU, compared septic with 20.0% (n = 53) in patients with severe sepsis and 59,2% (n = 138) in patients with septic shock.

Women were more likely to have genitourinary infections (11.4% vs 7.1% b = 0.002) and less likely to have lower respiratory tract infec- tions (70.1% ys 72.7%: p = 0.032) but otherwise had a similar distribution of infection sites, In comparison, distribution of infection sites did not show seasonal variations The occurrence rate exhibited a slow but steady increase since adolescence (98 per 100,000 population < 50 vr old), and increased sharply through most of the adulthood (1,330.8 per 100,000 population 71-75 yr old), and peaked in the elderly (15,200 per 100,000 population > 90 yr old) The occurrence rate ofsepsis exhibited significant seasonal vari- ation, being highest in winter (December, January, and February and lowest in 1 (September, October, and November autumn (Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http:/) links.lww.com/CCM/C543). The occurrence rate of severe sepsis and septic shock demonstrated similar seasonal variation The crude population mortality rates of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock were 137, 27, and 77 cases per 100,000 popu- lation per year, respectively. This represented 831,674 deaths with sepsis, 156,057 deaths with severe 1 447,219 sepsis, and deaths with septic shock nationally, although this s extrapola tion was only speculative. Mortality was significantly higher in men than women for sepsis and septic shock, but not severe sepsis (Table 3).

A total of 988 pathogens were isolated from 646 patients (37.6%) with sepsis, including 765 Gram-negative bacilli a and 178 Gram- positive cocci. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n= 237) was the most common isolated pathogen, followed by Acinetobacter bau- i (n = 183), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 91), Escherichia mannii coli (n = 86), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus n = 70) (Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/C542).\n\nAmong patients, with sepsis, 265 (15.4%) were diagnosed sepsis, whereas 233 patients (13.6%) met criteria for as severe c shock, The median SOFA score at the diagnosis of sep- septic was 2 (IOR, 0-3), 4 (IOR and septic shock severe sepsis, 3-6), and 9 (IQR, 7-11), respectively. However, only 237 patients (13.8%) were admitted into ICU, compared septic with 20.0% (n = 53) in patients with severe sepsis and 59,2% (n = 138) in patients with septic shock. The overall hospital mortality rate was 20.6% (353/1,716), and withholding life-sustaining including withdrawing g ther- apy in 109 and 83 patients, respectively.

Women were more likely to have genitourinary infections (11.4% vs 7.1% b = 0.002) and less likely to have lower respiratory tract infec- tions (70.1% ys 72.7%: p = 0.032) but otherwise had a similar distribution of infection sites, In comparison, distribution of infection sites did not show seasonal variations The occurrence rate exhibited a slow but steady increase since adolescence (98 per 100,000 population < 50 vr old), and increased sharply through most of the adulthood (1,330.8 per 100,000 population 71-75 yr old), and peaked in the elderly (15,200 per 100,000 population > 90 yr old) The occurrence rate ofsepsis exhibited significant seasonal vari- ation, being highest in winter (December, January, and February and lowest in 1 (September, October, and November autumn (Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http:/) links.lww.com/CCM/C543). The occurrence rate of severe sepsis and septic shock demonstrated similar seasonal variation The crude population mortality rates of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock were 137, 27, and 77 cases per 100,000 popu- lation per year, respectively. This represented 831,674 deaths with sepsis, 156,057 deaths with severe 1 447,219 sepsis, and deaths with septic shock nationally, although this s extrapola tion was only speculative. Mortality was significantly higher in men than women for sepsis and septic shock, but not severe sepsis (Table 3).

This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, with registration number NCT02285257.\n\n### RESULTS\n\n### Patient Enrollment\n\nDuring the 2-year study period, 22,552 adult patients in Yuetan Subdistrict were admitted into any of the 111 hospitals within the e able Beijing Public Health Information System. We were to review medical records of 21,191 admissions (94.0%). The reasons for not reviewing the rest 1,361 cases included missing medical records (n = 277) and rejection of application by the hospital (n = 1,084).

However, these standing the national burden of the clinical I syndrome, allo- cating limited healthcare resources, benchmarking the quality of healthcare delivery, and prioritizing research budgets (1). Ir addition, given the high occurrence rate and mortality of sepsis reported in our study, potential strategies for the prevention of sepsis should be proactively investigated, which might include but not limited to, vaccination in vulnerable population implementation of infection prevention programs mainly tar- geting nosocomial infections, promotion of increased aware- of sepsis as general ness s among healthcare providers s as well public, and development of real-time sepsis s screening system as a priority. Our study is s subject to other limitations. First, the retro- spective nature of our study might compromise the credibility of our results, However, we tried to capture every septic case by reviewing medical records of all hospitalized patients dur- ing the study period, which might be more reliable than using administrative data (32). Second, the occurrence rate of sepsis might be underestimated in our study, because e some patients might seek for medical care in military or private hospitals\n\nwhich were not included in our database. Nevertheless, the number of these patients was presumed to be very small due to reimbursement policy. Third, the reported mortality was rate all-cause estimate rather than attributable mortality rate. In fact, without a case-control design, it would be impossible to estimate the contributable mortality in a cohort study. Fourth the microbiologic data reported in this retrospective cohort study might be biased in favor of nosocomial bacterial patho- gens, due to lack of consistent sepsis workup o across all hospi and perception of well-established microbiology in most tals, community-acquired infections.

Considering the fact that China the disease burden of sepsis is stepping into o an aging society, expected to increase in the future. Given the importance of sepsis as a public health problem, prospective studies should be performed to confirm our findings, as well as to delineate the associated cost of care and long-term outcome.\n\n### REFERENCES 1Bone RC Balk RA\n\n1.

        "question": "How do patients with kidney disease estimate baseline serum creatinine using the MDRD equation, and what does it imply for AKI diagnosis based on estimated baseline SCr levels?",
        "answer": "1. In cases where baseline serum creatinine (SCr) is not available, patients with kidney disease can estimate it using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, assuming a baseline eGFR of 75 ml/min per 1.73. This approach is commonly used to estimate baseline SCr for many patients, especially in epidemiological studies of AKI.\n\n2. The use of estimated baseline SCr levels for AKI diagnosis implies that if a patient's SCr increases by at least 50% from their estimated baseline, it can be considered as AKI according to the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of Elasticity) criteria. However, it's important to note that the reliability of the diagnosis may be affected, as the true baseline SCr may not be captured, and the inferred diagnosis might be based on assumptions.\n\n3. The estimated SCr can be used to diagnose AKI as early as the first day, but the accuracy of the diagnosis may be compromised, as it's inferred and not directly measured. This can lead to potential misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, which could have implications for the patient's management and staging of the disease.\n\nOverall, while the MDRD equation can",

Furthermore, CKD and AKI may coexist all available clinical o using 1 (laboratory, imaging data history, and physical exam) it should be possible to o arrive at both an accurate diagnosis as well as an accurate estimate of baseline SCr. Importantly, excluding some cases of hemo- I resuscitation (discussed dilution secondary to massive f fuid below), the lowest SCr obtained during a hospitalization or greater than the baseline. This SCr usually e should be used to diagnose (and stage) AKI. For example, if no baseline SCr was available in Case A, diagnosis of AKI could be made using the MDRD estimated SCr (Table 9). If Case A were a 70-year-old white female with no evidence or of CKD, the baseline SCr would be 0.8 mg/dl history (71 umol/l) and a of AKI would be possible a diagnosis 1 day 1 (criterion 1, ≥50% increase from 1 baseline). on However, if the patient male, his was a 20-year-old black bpaseline SCr would be estimated 1 at 1.5 mg/dl (133 umol/1). s admission SCr is lower, this is assumed to be the Since his baseline SCr until day 7 when he returns to his true baseline, and this value can be taken as the baseline. These dynamic in interpretation changes seen in epidemiologic not studies, which 1 are conducted when all the data are present, but are in clinical medicine.

Frequent measurement of SCr in high-risk patients, or in patients in which AKI is suspected is therefore encouraged-see Chapter 2.3. The second issue highlighted by Case A is the importance of baseline SCr measurements.

This estimation helps in determining a reference SCr for staging AKI. If a patient's actual baseline SCr is unknown, the MDRD estimated SCr can be used to diagnose AKI. For example, if a patient has no evidence of CKD and their baseline SCr is estimated at 0.8 mg/dl (71 umol/l), an AKI diagnosis can be made if there is a ≥50% increase from this baseline. Similarly, if a patient's baseline SCr is estimated at 1.5 mg/dl (133 umol/l), a return to this value after an episode of AKI indicates recovery.

        "answer": "1. The context discusses the nephrotoxic effects of gadolinium-based contrast agents, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney conditions like advanced diabetes or kidney disease. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a risk associated with these agents, especially in patients with severe AKI and CKD. The European Medicines Agency has issued a contraindication for gadodiamide in patients with a GFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and the US FDA has requested warnings on packaging for a higher risk in patients with a GFR between 30 and 60 ml/min.\n\n2. Strategies to reduce risk during administration include using a macrocyclic chelate, such as gadoteridol, which has a lower risk compared to linear chelates, and minimizing the dose to achieve the necessary image. The use of a volume-to-creatinine clearance ratio can help predict risk.\n\n3. Nonpharmacological prevention strategies mentioned include minimizing contrast-media volume, using low-osmolality contrast media, and administering non-iodinated contrast agents with definitive strategies. However, the context does not provide specific steps or guidelines for reducing risk in patients with pre-existing kidney conditions.\n\n4. The reference",

The Work Group recommends, therefore, that the dose of contrast medium should be better expressed in relation to both volume and concentration, e.g., grams iodine, which also directly relates to the diagnostic capacity, the primary purpose of the contrast medium. Such \"double expression would also facilitate comparison between different studies on epidemiology and prognosis of CI-AKI. It is well known that, when measuring the plasma clearance of a GFR marker (e.g., with the contrast medium fohexol), the AUC is directly related to the dose of iohexol and inversely related to the GFR. Thus, by mathematically the AUC estimating and knowing the injected iodine AUC.

However discontinuation of patient's response to treatment (e.g., o possible nephrotoxic agent) provides important information to the diagnosis Nephrotoxic drugs account for some part of AKI in 20-30% of patients. Often, agents like antimicrobials (e.g. aminoglyco- sides, amphotericin) and radiocontrast are used in patients that are already at high risk for AKI (e.g., critically ill patients with difficult sepsis). Thus, it is often discern exactly what contribution these agents have",

All other studies did not show a beneficial effect on mortality (Suppl Table 25). Overall, thi evidence was deemed to be of moderate quality and the possible positive effect on mortality dubious The effect of NAC on the incidence of CI-AKI is quite variable. As is shown in the evidence profile (Suppl Table 24) the evidence that NAC reduces CI-AKI, as defined in the different trials, comes from studies with rather heterogeneou: results; most of the studies were of either high or modes quality. In one study, a protective-even dose-dependent- effect was observed,498 In that study, the risk for CI-AKI was reduced by 54.5% in the standard-dose NAC group and by 75.8% in the high-dose NAC group. These findings are in sharp contrast to many other studies showing no effect and in particular, with the large study of Webb et al.,499 which wa: terminated early after enrollment of 487 patients because of a determination of futility by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee.

Although the clinical significance is not clear, it is now recognized that etomidate, when used for induction for intubation, will suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis [185. 186]. Moreover, a  subanalysis of the CORTICUS trial [178] revealed that the use of etomidate before application of low-dose steroids was associated with an increased 28-day [187]. An inap- mortality rate propriately low random cortisol level (<18 ug/dL) in patient with shock would be considered an indication for traditional adrenal insufficiency steroid therapy a along guidelines.\n\nRationale.

Steroids may be indicated in the presence of steroid therapy or adrenal dysfunction, but a history whether low-dose steroids have preventive potency in reducing the incidence of severe sepsis and septic shock in critically ill patients cannot be answered.

        "answer": "1. According to context 1, renal failure patients should follow the AAMI standards for contamination regarding bacteria and endotoxins in dialysis fluids. This means that the fluids and replacement fluids for patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) should comply with the AAMI (Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation) standards.\n\n2. The context also recommends that local standards should be followed if they exceed the AAMI standards, as stated in context 2. This implies that in cases where local standards are more stringent, patients with AKI would need to adhere to those standards as well.\n\nSo, the answer is to follow the AAMI and, if necessary, local standards for acceptable levels of bacteria and endotoxins in dialysis fluid.",

Definition and staging of AK] are based on the Risk, Injury, Failure; Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease (RIFLE) and Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria and studies on risk relationships. The treatment chapters cover oharmacological approaches to prevent or treat AKI, and management of renal replacement for kidney failure from AKI. Guideline recommendations are based on svstematic reviews of relevant trials. Appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the GRADE: approach.

            " private hospitals in China. measures need be taken to further improve the quality of care and out comes of ICU patients in private hospitals In this study, ICU patients admitted to tertiary hospi tals in China had a lower CAUTI incidence than patients admitted to secondary hospitals. Being treated in a sec- I was associated with a higher CAUT] ondary hospital incidence in the multivariate analysis. The difference in the clinical care, o diagnostic protocols, assessment, and treatment of hospital infection might account for the observed. discrepancy in the CAUTI incidence among (CU patients. Recent studies have also observed higher mortality rates in secondary hospitals than in tertiary hospitals [21, 22]. These complications also reflect the combined effect of patient case-mix and quality of care In China, tertiary hospitals are usually comprehensive referral-based, general hospitals responsible for provid ing specialist health services and performing a larger role with regard to medical education and scientific research They also serve as medical hubs providing care to multi ole regions, while secondary hospitals are responsible for providing comprehensive health services, medical edu. cation and conducting research on a regional basis. Fo. one thing, patients with acute and critical illnesses tend to be treated in tertiary hospitals rather than secondary hospitals, resulting in a higher proportion of patients with acute and critical illnesses in tertiary care hospi tals, and for another, tertiary hospitals are usually more adequately staffed and equipped compared to secondary hospitals, which may lead to a lower rate of complica tions in ICU patients from tertiary hospitals. Intensive training and technical support for ICU staff in secondary hospitals should be implemented to narrow the gaps and variations in the care and outcomes of ICU patients We found 1 that an ICU-to-hospital bed percentage of more than 2% was independently associated with a lower mortality rate in ICU patients, which is consist. ent with a contemporary study 23]. Previous studies\n\nindicated that larger hospitals and hospitals with higl ICU occupancy were more likely to increase their num ber of ICU beds compared to other hospitals. Smal hospitals and hospitals with relatively low ICU occu pancy were less likely to add ICU beds in the subse- quent vear 24l. When the ICU occupancy rate is high lower ICU bed ratios could possibly result in delaved ICU : admissions. which in turn affect patient may outcomes It is noteworthy that the result should be interpreted with caution. A combination of factors including ICU bed occupancy rate, acuity of patients d capacity of and other departments (e.g.. operatior rooms), should be considered when the deci o making t sion whether to expand ICUs in a hospital A large number of studies have reported that a higher number of nursing staff was associated with a lower in-hospital mortality rate [7, 22, 25, 26]. Our study ICU with a showed a similar trend. Patients from an . bed-to-nurse ratio of more than 0.5 (two nurses per bed) had: The bed-to- significantly higher mortality. c of nurse staff nurse ratio is a widely used indicator ing in ICUs and general wards, and larger numbers of bed-to-nurses indicate worse staffing. ICU patients are highly dependent on nursing care due to the nature of their illnesses, the need for continuous invasive moni toring, and the need for multiple organ system support Variables that mediated the relationship between nurse staffing and the patient outcome of death were inferred to be insufficient collaboration, physician missed sive workload, increased medical errors. and nursing care 3, 27]. Moreover, one key role that ICU nurses perform is patient monitoring. ICU nurses are at the patient's bedside around the clock and are para. mount for the early identification of problems. Failure of such monitoring may cause life-threatening compli cations such as pneumothorax or unexpected extuba- tion, which requires prompt recognition and treatment 28. A shortage of nursing staff could be associated with insufficient supervision and might inhibit the early recognition of any changes in the status of the patients 25]. This finding could provide useful informatior for nurse managers and policymakers to o determine i staffing levels are adequate and safe, not just whether there is a relationship between staffing and outcomes This finding should be considered in light of the lower other low-and nurse-to-patient ratios China and middle-income countries. It should also be noted 1 that the average bed-to-nurse ratio used in this study would not be equal to the nurse-to-patient ratio of the units where the numbers of nurses and patients are in con. stant dynamic quality of c change.

In the industrialized world, two before- and-after studies. observed tenfold reductions in mortality when children ourpura/meningococcal septic shock with were treated with fluid boluses, inotropes, and mechanical ventilation in the community emergency department [545 5461. In one randomized trial, septic shock mortality was reduced (40-12 %) when increased fluid boluses, blood and inotropes we given to attain a Scvo2 monitoring 70 % [511l. A quality improvement goal of s reater than 7 study achieved a reduction in severe sepsis mortality from 4.0 to 2.4 %) with the delivery of fluid boluses and antibiotics in the first hour in a pediatric emergency department to reverse clinical signs of shock [547] Children 1 normally have a lower blood pressure than adults, and a fall in blood pressure can be prevented by rate Therefore vasoconstriction : and increasing heart 1 blood pressure : alone is not a reliable endpoint for assessing the adequacy of resuscitation. However, once hypotension occurs, cardiovascular collapse may soon follow. Thus. fluid resuscitation is recommended for both normotensive and hypotensive children in hypovolemic shock [542-5541.

For example, the measurement of urine output does not imply that the urinary bladder catheteriza- tion is mandatory patients, and clinicians should the risks any procedures with the benefits balance Furthermore, clinicians must individualize care decisions based on the totality of the clinical situation. However, it is advisable to include AKI stage in these decisions. AKI management of patients with The evaluation and requires attention to cause and stage of AKI, as well as factors that relate to further injury to the kidney, or complications from decreased kidney function. Since AKI is a risk factor for important to evaluate patients with AKI for new of pre-existing CKD. If patients have worsening onset CKD, manage detailed in the KDOOI CKT patients as Guideline (Guidelines 7-15). If patients do not have CKD, consider them to be at increased risk for CKD and care for them as detailed in the KDOQI CKD Guideline 3 for patients at increased risk for CKD.\n\n### RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nClinical research aimed early testing management also trials should needed.

Specifying the recommendation for the rapid administration of antimicrobial therapy to be given 'as soon as possible after recognition and within the first hour of sepsis and septic shock' as a strong recommendation with moderate evidence level. 2. Introducing a Best-Practice-Statement recommendation for de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy, suggesting narrowing the antimicrobial spectrum after pathogen identification and resistance spectrum, or upon clinical improvement. 3. Recommending an optimized dosage of antimicrobial therapy for sepsis/septic shock based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. 4. Highlighting the increased distribution volume and changes in kidney and liver function in patients with sepsis or septic shock, emphasizing the need to avoid underdosing in antimicrobial therapy, considering specific differences among different drug classes. These updates reflect a comprehensive review and adjustment of antimicrobial therapy recommendations to improve patient outcomes in sepsis and septic shock cases.",

Firstly, in terms of region, a higher proportion of tertiary hospitals are located in Western China compared to secondary hospitals. Secondly, tertiary hospitals are more commonly situated in metropolitan cities compared to secondary hospitals, which are more prevalent in other cities and rural areas. Additionally, tertiary hospitals tend to have a higher ownership rate of public institutions compared to secondary hospitals. Moreover, tertiary hospitals generally have a larger number of beds, with a significant portion having more than 1000 beds, whereas secondary hospitals often have fewer beds, with a considerable proportion having less than 500 beds or between 500-1000 beds.",

        "answer": "1. According to the provided context, fluid overload can occur in critically ill children due to factors such as changes in solute burden, particularly in cases of AKI (acute kidney injury) and CHF (congestive heart failure). These conditions can lead to the accumulation of fluid in the body. The context also mentions that a study found a significant association between fluid overload and mortality, with ORs for death increasing with higher fluid overload percentages.\n\n2. The context does not directly state that there is a specific correlation between fluid overload and mortality rates in all patients with MODS, but it highlights the importance of fluid overload as a significant issue in pediatric AKI and its association with mortality. The study mentioned shows that a higher percentage of fluid overload at the time of initiation of dialysis was associated with higher mortality.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, there is a correlation between fluid overload and mortality rates in patients with MODS, particularly in the context of AKI.",

        "ground_truth": "Fluid overload (FO) is a significant concern in patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Factors contributing to FO include the severity of illness and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). There is a clear correlation between fluid overload and mortality rates in these patients. Studies have shown that higher percentages of fluid overload are associated with increased mortality. For example, one study found a mortality rate of 65.6% in patients with more than 20% fluid overload, compared to 29.6% mortality in those with less than 10% fluid overload. Additionally, preventing or reducing fluid overload through interventions such as early initiation of RRT may improve outcomes, although strong evidence supporting this is currently lacking.",

        "ground_truth": "The impact on catheter function, catheter-related infections, and complications between the use of single-lumen catheters and non-single-lumen catheters in pediatric renal replacement therapy varies based on patient weight. For neonates, double-lumen 7F catheters are recommended for insertion into the femoral artery or vein. For patients weighing 3-6kg, double- or triple-lumen 7F catheters can be inserted into the jugular, subclavian, or femoral veins. Those weighing 6-15kg can have double-lumen 8F catheters inserted into the jugular, subclavian, or femoral veins, while those over 15kg may have double-lumen 9F or 10F catheters, or triple-lumen 12F catheters, inserted into the jugular, subclavian, or femoral veins. The choice between surgically placed Tenckhoff catheters and percutaneously placed catheters may also impact outcomes, with some studies suggesting fewer complications with surgically placed catheters. Research recommendations include investigating the use of tunneled versus non-tunneled catheters for acute kidney injury (AKI) patients to determine their effect on catheter function, catheter-related infections, and complications, as well as developing better methods for selecting access sites and balancing risks and benefits for individual patients.",

The Work Group recommends, therefore, that the dose of contrast medium should be better expressed in relation to both volume and concentration, e.g., grams iodine, which also directly relates to the diagnostic capacity, the primary purpose of the contrast medium. Such \"double expression would also facilitate comparison between different studies on epidemiology and prognosis of CI-AKI. It is well known that, when measuring the plasma clearance of a GFR marker (e.g., with the contrast medium fohexol), the AUC is directly related to the dose of iohexol and inversely related to the GFR. Thus, by mathematically the AUC estimating and knowing the injected iodine AUC. Thus, dose, the GER can be calculated by dose AUC= dose - GFR, and AUC i directly related to the systemic exposure of a drug, including the contrast medium which, in with its efficacy and 1 turn, is mostly correlated 434 experimental study435 toxicity.

The 2008 SSC children recommendations reflected these findings, and the strength of the rhAPC recommendation was downgraded to a suggestion for use in adult patients with a clinical assessment of high risk of death, most of whom will have Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores >250 multiple organ failure (grade 2C: quality of evidence was C [7. The 2008 downgraded from 2004. from B to also also recommended against use of rhAPC in guidelines low-risk adult patients, most of whom will have APACHE I scores (grade 1A), and <20 or single organ failures in all pediatric patients (grade 1B). against use: SHOCK trial (1.696 the PROwESS S The results of t patients) were released in late 2011, showing no benefit of rhAPC in patients with septic shock (mortality 26.4 % for\n\nrhAPC. 24.2 % placebo) with a relative risk of 1.09 and a P value of 0.31 [231]. The drug was withdrawn from the market and is no longer available, negating need for an SSC recommendation regarding its use.\n\nO. Mechanical ventilation of sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome 1.We recommend that clinicians target a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg predicted body weight in patients with sepsis- distress syndrome (ARDS) induced acute respiratory (grade 1A vs. 12 mL/kg). 2. We recommend that plateau pressures be measured in with ARDS and that the initial upper limit patients 1 goal for plateau pressures in a passively inflated lung be 30 cmH,O (grade 1B).\n\nRationale. note, studies used to determine recom mendations in this section enrolled patients using criteria from the American-European Consensus Criteria Defini tion for Acute Lung Iniury (ALD and ARDS [2321 For this document., we have used the updated Berlin definition and used the terms mild moderate and severe ARDS (PaO- FIO2 <200. and <300.. <100 mm H dg. respectivelv) for nown as ALI and ARDS [2331 he syndromes previously k Several multicenter randomized trials have been formed in patients with established ARDS to evaluate the effects of limiting inspiratory pressure through moderation of tidal volume [234-2381. These studies showed differing results that may have been caused by differences in airwat: pressures in the treatment and control groups [233. 234 239]. Several meta-analyses suggest decreased mortality in patients with a pressure- and volume-limited strategy for established ARl DS [240. 2411 The largest trial of a volume- and pressure-limited an absolute 9 % decrease in all-cause showed strategy patients with ARDS mortality ventilated with tida volumes of 6 mL/kg compared with 12 mL/kg e of pre- dicted body and aiming for a plateau weight [233]. The use of lung-protective cm HO pressure strategies for patients with ARDS is supported b: clinica trials and has been widely accepted, but the precise choice of tidal volume for an individual patient with ARDS may require adjustment for such factors as the plateau pressure achieved, the level of PEEP chosen, the compliance of the compartment, and the vigor of the thoracoabdominal with patient's breathing effort. Patients profound meta- bolic acidosis, high obligate minute ventilations, or r short stature may require additional manipulation of tidal vol- umes. Some clinicians believe it may be safe to ventilate with tidal volumes ) >6 mL/kg PBWa as long as the plateau <30 cm H.O 242,243 . The pressure can be maintained validity of this ceiling value will depend on the patient's effort, as those who are actively breathing generate higher transalveolar pressures for a given plateau pressure than\n\npatients whc o are passively inflated. Conversely, patients with very stiff chest walls may require plateau pressures >30 cmHO to meet vital clinical obiectives. A retro spective study suggested should be that : tidal volumes lowered even with plateau pressures <30 cmH-O [2441 as with decreased were associated lower plateau pressures in-hospital mortality [245] High tidal volumes that are coupled with high plateau pressures should be avoided in ARDS.

Three large relatively of multicenter trials using higher versus lower rlevels PEEP in conjunction s did not with low tida volumes uncover benefit or harm [255-257]. A meta-analysis using individual patient data showed no benefit in all patients\n\nwith ARDS; however, patients with moderate or severe ARDS (Pao-/FIo2 ratio <200 mm 1 Hg) had decreased with the use of higher PEEP. whereas those with mortality: mild ARDS did not [2581. Two options are recommended for PEEP titration. One option is to titrate PEEP (and tidal to bedside measurements of thoraco- volume) according pulmonary compliance with the obiective of obtaining the best compliance, reflecting a favorable balance of lung recruitment and overdistension [259]. The second option is to titrate PEEP based on severity of oxygenation deficit and guided by the Fio2 required to maintain adequate oxygenation [234, 255,256]. A PEEP>5 cm H,0is usually eARDSNet required to avoid lung collapse [260]. The standard PEEP strategy is shown in Appendix 3. The higher PEEP recommended for ARDS is shown in strategy Appendix 4 and comes from the ALVEOLI trial [257]. in sepsis patients suggest recruitment maneuvers : with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS S (grade 2C).

            "smaller and specialized hospitals, and the most substan- tial issues facing private hospitals are the recruitment of high-quality physicians and the lack of public insurance coverage. While public hospitals tvpically have more beds, staff, and tertiary care capacity, they usually allo. cate sufficient medical talent, equipment and resources to meet the needs of patients  19 . A recent study in Bei iing. China showed that the technical efficiency, pure rechnical efficiency, and scale efficiency of public hos.- pitals were higher than those of private hospitals [20: In addition, public hospitals usually have a better repu- tation than private hospitals, and reputation also influ- ences the performance and efficiency of hospitals. As a result, differences exist in the outcomes of ICU patients in public and private hospitals. With the rapid develonp ment of private hospitals in China. measures need be taken to further improve the quality of care and out comes of ICU patients in private hospitals In this study, ICU patients admitted to tertiary hospi tals in China had a lower CAUTI incidence than patients admitted to secondary hospitals. Being treated in a sec- I was associated with a higher CAUT] ondary hospital incidence in the multivariate analysis. The difference in the clinical care, o diagnostic protocols, assessment, and treatment of hospital infection might account for the observed. discrepancy in the CAUTI incidence among (CU patients. Recent studies have also observed higher mortality rates in secondary hospitals than in tertiary hospitals [21, 22]. These complications also reflect the combined effect of patient case-mix and quality of care In China, tertiary hospitals are usually comprehensive referral-based, general hospitals responsible for provid ing specialist health services and performing a larger role with regard to medical education and scientific research They also serve as medical hubs providing care to multi ole regions, while secondary hospitals are responsible for providing comprehensive health services, medical edu. cation and conducting research on a regional basis. Fo. one thing, patients with acute and critical illnesses tend to be treated in tertiary hospitals rather than secondary hospitals, resulting in a higher proportion of patients with acute and critical illnesses in tertiary care hospi tals, and for another, tertiary hospitals are usually more adequately staffed and equipped compared to secondary hospitals, which may lead to a lower rate of complica tions in ICU patients from tertiary hospitals. Intensive training and technical support for ICU staff in secondary hospitals should be implemented to narrow the gaps and variations in the care and outcomes of ICU patients We found 1 that an ICU-to-hospital bed percentage of more than 2% was independently associated with a lower mortality rate in ICU patients, which is consist. ent with a contemporary study 23].

Additionally, colloid fluid is more expensive. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to use crystalloid fluid for fluid resuscitation in patients with sepsis and septic shock. Research suggests that balanced crystalloid fluid can reduce the occurrence of major kidney adverse events at 30 days. The greatest benefit of using balanced crystalloid fluid is seen in populations with high creatinine and high chloride levels. Compared to a restricted chloride strategy, a strategy involving chloride-containing solutions increases the risk of acute kidney injury and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Thus, regardless of the type of fluid solution used, it is recommended to monitor serum chloride levels to avoid hyperchloremia.",

        "answer": "1. The International Society for Standardization is in the process of preparing a standard for dialysis fluid quality in CRRT. However, until the standard is in place, international standards should be followed, with compliance regarding bacteria and endotoxins, as recommended by the American Association of Medical Instruments (AAMI).\n\n2. For patients with AKI, the effluent volume during CRRT is recommended to be 20-25 ml/kg/h, and the actual dose delivery may be smaller than the prescribed due to various factors such as hemodynamic instability, patient size, access issues, technical problems, and filter clotting. It is essential to carefully monitor the delivered dose and consider factors like fluid balance, acid-base balance, electrolyte homeostasis, and nutrition when determining the RRT prescription.\n\nTherefore, the context provides information about the recommended dialysis fluid quality and effluent volume, as well as factors affecting RRT dose, but does not explicitly state the latest update on the International Society's standard. The answer is present but not in the exact form required, so the verdict is '1'.",

These studies showed differing results that may have been caused by differences in airwat: pressures in the treatment and control groups [233. 234 239]. Several meta-analyses suggest decreased mortality in patients with a pressure- and volume-limited strategy for established ARl DS [240. 2411 The largest trial of a volume- and pressure-limited an absolute 9 % decrease in all-cause showed strategy patients with ARDS mortality ventilated with tida volumes of 6 mL/kg compared with 12 mL/kg e of pre- dicted body and aiming for a plateau weight [233]. The use of lung-protective cm HO pressure strategies for patients with ARDS is supported b: clinica trials and has been widely accepted, but the precise choice of tidal volume for an individual patient with ARDS may require adjustment for such factors as the plateau pressure achieved, the level of PEEP chosen, the compliance of the compartment, and the vigor of the thoracoabdominal with patient's breathing effort.

Ventilation strategies significantly impact patient outcomes in ALI and ARDS, with meta-analyses suggesting decreased mortality in patients with a pressure- and volume-limited strategy.

Our findings that the occurrence rate of sepsis and its complications signifi- cantly increased with age were consistent with Angus et al (39) and the elderly septic patients with comorbidities were more likely to be hospitalized (40).

The ICU admission rate among septic patients in our study was even lower, which might also explain, at least in part, the observed high mortality rate. The population-adjusted ICU beds in China was estimated as only one fifth of that of the United States (43), which inevitably resulted in less tendency to admit some critically ill patients into the ICU.

Arginine availability is reduced in sepsis. which can lead to reduced nitric oxide synthesis, loss of microcirculatory regulation, and enhanced production of superoxide and peroxynitrite. However, arginine supple- mentation could lead to unwanted  vasodilation and hypotension [452, 4531. Human trials of L-arginine sup-  generally small and plementation have been renorted variable effects on mortality [454-4571 The only study ir septic patients showed improved survival, but had limi- tations in study design [4551. Other studies suggested nc benefit [449. 454. 4551 or possible harm [4551 in the septic patients. Some authors found subgroup improvement in secondary e outcomes in septic patients. such as reduced infectious complications [454 4551 and length of hospital stay [4541. but the relevance of these findings in the face of potential harm is unclear Glutamine. Glutamine levels are also reduced during critical illness. Exogenous supplementation can improve gut mucosal atrophy and permeability, possibly leading to reduced bacterial translocation. Other potential benefits enhanced immune function. decreased pro- are e cel inflammatory cytokine production, and higher levels glutathione and antioxidative capacity [452, 4531. How- ever. the clinical significance of theset findings is s no clearly established Although a previous meta-analysis showed I mortality reduction [428], four other meta-analyses did not [458- 462]. Other small studies not included in those meta- analyses had similar results [463, 4641. Three recent well- designed studies also failed to show a mortality benefit in the primary analyses 227, 465. 466 . but again. none focused specifically on septic patients. Two small studies on septic patients showed no benefit in mortality 1 rates 467, 468] but a significant reduction in infectious com- plications [467] and I a faster recovery orgar dysfunction 468. Some previous individual studies anc meta-analyses showed positive secondary outcomes, such as reduction in infectious morbidity 461. 462, 465 and dysfunction 462 . Beneficial effects were found organ c mostly in trials using parenteral rather than enteral glu- tamine. However, recent and well-sized studies could not demonstrate a reduction of infectious complications[227 dysfunction 465, 466 , even with parenteral or organ glutamine. An ongoing trial (REDOXS) of 1,200 patients will test both enteral and parenteral glutamine and anti- critically ill t supplementation in mechanically oxidant ventilated patients 469 . Although no clear benefit coulc be demonstrated in clinical trials with supplemental glu- tamine, there is no sign of harm The omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) are eicosanoid precur- sors. The prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes produced from EPA/GLA are less potent than their\n\narachidonic acid-derived equivalents, reducing the pro inflammatory impact on the immune response [452, 453]. Three early studies were e summarized in a meta-analysis that reported a significant mortality reduction, increased ventilator-free days. and reduced risk of new organ dys- function [4701.

        "ground_truth": "The effects of different feeding strategies, including enteral and parenteral nutrition, as well as immune-enhancing nutritional supplements like arginine, glutamine, and omega-3 fatty acids, on outcomes in critically ill patients with severe infections and sepsis have been extensively studied. Studies have shown mixed results regarding the benefits of various feeding strategies and supplements. Enteral feeding strategies, such as trophic feeding and full caloric early enteral feeding, have been compared, with inconclusive results regarding mortality but some evidence suggesting a reduction in infectious complications with trophic feeding. Parenteral nutrition has been compared to enteral nutrition, with some studies suggesting a higher incidence of infectious complications with parenteral nutrition. Immune-enhancing nutritional supplements like arginine and glutamine have shown variable effects on mortality, with some studies suggesting possible harm or no benefit. Omega-3 fatty acids have been associated with reduced pro-inflammatory impact on the immune response, but studies on their effects in critically ill patients have shown mixed results, with no clear benefit demonstrated in terms of mortality. Overall, while some studies suggest potential benefits of certain feeding strategies and supplements, more research is needed to establish clear guidelines for their use in critically ill patients with severe infections and sepsis.",

        "ground_truth": "Factors contributing to childhood acute renal failure include various aspects such as dialysis types, fluid strategies, and patient outcomes. Dialysis types encompass continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration, continuous renal replacement therapy, intermittent hemodialysis, and peritoneal dialysis. Fluid strategies involve considerations like fluid overload, sodium and ultrafiltration modeling, and intravenous fluid restriction postoperatively. Patient outcomes are influenced by factors like mortality rates, renal recovery, and the intensity of renal support.",

For instance, strong recommendations are made for actions that should be applied in most cases, while weak recommendations are for actions that may be sensible for individual patients after individual assessment. Additionally, the level of evidence plays a crucial role, with high-quality evidence based on data from randomized controlled trials carrying more weight than lower-quality evidence based on well-done observational studies or poorly conducted trials.",
