Since the context is about the application of ultrasound-guided femoral artery catheterization in severe COVID-19 patients, I'll try to answer the question.

The question is: ""外周动脉置管的首次成功率如何计算？"" which translates to ""How to calculate the first-time success rate of femoral artery catheterization?""

Based on the provided context, the first-time success rate of femoral artery catheterization is calculated as:

首次置管成功率 = 首次置管成功例数 / 置管总例数 x 100%

where ""首次置管成功例数"" refers to the number of successful first-time catheterizations, and ""置管总例数"" refers to the total number of catheterization attempts.

Verdict: 1 (the answer is present in the context)

Please let me know if I'm correct or not! 😊

However, the data from China are scarce. This study was designed to investigate how differences in patient outcomes are associated with differences in hospital and ICU structure variables in China throughout 2019\n\nMethods: This was a multicenter observational study. Data from a total of 2820 hospitals were collected using the National Clinical lmprovement System Data that reports CU information in China. Data collection consisted of al information on the hospital and ICU structural factors, including the hospital type, number of beds, staffng, among others, and b) ICU patient outcomes, including the mortality rate as well as the incidence of ventilator-associated oneumonia (VAP). catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02%(3.78%, 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP CRBSL, and CAUT\n\npneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02% (3.78%., 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP. CRBSL, and CAUT were 5.58 (1.55.11.67) per 1000 ventilator davs., 0.63 (0.2.01) per 1000 catheter davs,and 142 (0.37,3,40) per 1000 catheter davs, respectively. Mortality was sianificantly lower in public hospitals (B= -0.018(- 0031.- 0.005) p=0.006), hospitals with an ICU-to-hospital bed percentage of more than 2% (B= -0.027 (-0.034,-0.019)., p<0.001) and higber in hospitals with a bed-to-nurse ratio of more than 0 5:1 (B=0009 (0 001 0017) np=0 027) The incidence of VAP was lower in public hospitals (B= -0.036 (- 0.054.-0018), p<0.001). The incidence of CRBSls was lower in public hospitals (B= -0.008 (- 0.014,-0002), p=0.011) and hiaher in secondary hospitals (B=0.005 (0.001.,0.009) p= 0.010), while the incidence of CAUTls was higher in secondary hospitals (B=0.010 (0002. 0.018)., p= 0.015)\n\ndwliu98@163.com [Zhen Li, Xudong Ma and Sifa Gao contributed equally to this work \'Department of Critical Care Medicine.

Several factors, including ICU struc ture, ICU organization and d the care process, can influ ence ICU 1 extensive performance 1-3]. Despite the ICUs, the the quality of care literature addressing impact of such factors remains controversial, and a dili. gent assessment of care components is required It is well known that ICU structural factors vary within and regions [4, 51. However, most different countries related conducted in Western studies have been coun- tries [6. 71. Little evidence regarding the structural factors of ICUs in China is available [81, China still faces chal lenges in providing optimal and equitable management strategies for ICU patients across the nation because its broad geography and unbalanced economic develop ment. A previous study described critical care resources in Guangdong Province 9. Another study evaluated the practices, outcomes, and costs related to mechanical ven: tilation within ICUs in Beijing [10]. Nonetheless, those studies were limited to the regions in which the surveys were administered and feature small e sizes: it is I sample also not clear whether those resources were e associated with ICU care provision, treatment patterns, and patient demands outcomes. Finally, increasing  and I rising costs significant challenges to the delivery of high-qual pose: ity and affordable critical care to a growing population of patients. Optimizing ICU organization is a potentia opportunity to improve patient outcomes and the use of resources. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate hos- pital and ICU structural factors and patient outcomes in China. Moreover, we aimed to identify the associa- tion between these variables and patient outcomes, with structural factors, including ICU a focus on potential structural resources and staffing levels. We hypothesized that patients admitted to hospitals that were government- funded, tertiary, well-equipped, and better-staffed woulc have a decreased risk of ICU mortality and occurrence of VAP, CRBSIs and CAUTIs after adjusting for region, dis ease severity, and other confounders.\n\nDesign This nationwide, database observational e study was a National Clinical 2019.

Hospitals in China are classified in a 3-tier svstem (primary, second arvy or tertiary hospital) that recognizes a hospital's ability to provide medical care, medical education, and conduct medical research. Tertiary hospitals, similar to a tertiary referral hospital in the West, are usually comprehen- sive, referral, general hospitals responsible for provid- ing specialist health services, perform a larger role with 1 and scientific research regard to medical education and serve as medical hubs providing care to multiple regions Secondary hospitals, similar to : a regional hospital e district hospital in the West, tend to be affiliated with medium-sized city, county, or district and are responsible for providing comprehensive health services and medical education and conducting research on a regional basis. Ir contrast, primary hospitals are primary health care insti- tutions whose main function is to provide primary pre- vention directly to the population, however, they rarely admit and treat critically ill patients. Therefore, primary hospitals were not included in the scope of the study The enrolled tertiary and secondary hospitals voluntar- ily participated and were selected by the China-NCCOC The selection criteria were as follows. (1) The ICU had to have more than five beds. (2) The ICU had to have the ability to diagnose and treat the relevant medical dis- eases that were evaluated as quality control items (such catheter- ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as related blood stream infections (CRBSIs), and catheter- associated urinary tract""

First., the use of secondary data limited essential variables such as the patient-level characteristics or uncontrolled confound- ers (e.g., education level of the staff. ICU bed occu- pancy rate) needed to understand the predictive factors of the patients' outcomes. To reduce these methodo- logical problems, we applied multivariate analysis using s adjusted for generalized linear mixed models patient disease severity using the APACHE I score, which has been shown to be an important predictor of patient outcomes [29, 30]. Second, since only one year of data was reported, presented and summarized in this study of the structural factors and health the relationships. outcomes could: not be analysed continuously anc dynamically. Third, this was an observational study and therefore, prone to selection bias. Causal relationships cannot be drawn due to the cross-sectional nature of the study design. Fourth, listwise deletion was used to data, which may cause bias in the handle the missing of the parameters 31 . Despite these limi- estimates tations, the results of this study are highly meaning- ful in that they underscore the necessity of nonpatient factors, including hospital and ICU structural factors, addi- as a way to reduce : adverse patient outcomes. In : tion, we have improved the generalizability of the find- ings by using national administrative data, unlike most data previous studies, which were conducted using from only certain regions or hospitals.

Note: The answer is present in the context. The study found that specific structural factors, including hospital ownership, hospital type, ICU-hospital bed percentage, and bed-to-nurse ratio, were associated with patient outcomes. The study also found that certain outcomes, such as mortality rates and recovery times, were impacted by these structural factors. However, the specific details of the outcomes and the associations with structural factors are not explicitly stated in the provided context.

Several factors, including ICU struc ture, ICU organization and d the care process, can influ ence ICU 1 extensive performance 1-3]. Despite the ICUs, the the quality of care literature addressing impact of such factors remains controversial, and a dili. gent assessment of care components is required It is well known that ICU structural factors vary within and regions [4, 51. However, most different countries related conducted in Western studies have been coun- tries [6. 71. Little evidence regarding the structural factors of ICUs in China is available [81, China still faces chal lenges in providing optimal and equitable management strategies for ICU patients across the nation because its broad geography and unbalanced economic develop ment. A previous study described critical care resources in Guangdong Province 9. Another study evaluated the practices, outcomes, and costs related to mechanical ven: tilation within ICUs in Beijing [10]. Nonetheless, those studies were limited to the regions in which the surveys were administered and feature small e sizes: it is I sample also not clear whether those resources were e associated with ICU care provision, treatment patterns, and patient demands outcomes. Finally, increasing  and I rising costs significant challenges to the delivery of high-qual pose: ity and affordable critical care to a growing population of patients. Optimizing ICU organization is a potentia opportunity to improve patient outcomes and the use of resources. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate hos- pital and ICU structural factors and patient outcomes in China. Moreover, we aimed to identify the associa- tion between these variables and patient outcomes, with structural factors, including ICU a focus on potential structural resources and staffing levels. We hypothesized that patients admitted to hospitals that were government- funded, tertiary, well-equipped, and better-staffed woulc have a decreased risk of ICU mortality and occurrence of VAP, CRBSIs and CAUTIs after adjusting for region, dis ease severity, and other confounders.\n\nDesign This nationwide, database observational e study was a National Clinical 2019.

Hospitals in China are classified in a 3-tier svstem (primary, second arvy or tertiary hospital) that recognizes a hospital's ability to provide medical care, medical education, and conduct medical research. Tertiary hospitals, similar to a tertiary referral hospital in the West, are usually comprehen- sive, referral, general hospitals responsible for provid- ing specialist health services, perform a larger role with 1 and scientific research regard to medical education and serve as medical hubs providing care to multiple regions Secondary hospitals, similar to : a regional hospital e district hospital in the West, tend to be affiliated with medium-sized city, county, or district and are responsible for providing comprehensive health services and medical education and conducting research on a regional basis. Ir contrast, primary hospitals are primary health care insti- tutions whose main function is to provide primary pre- vention directly to the population, however, they rarely admit and treat critically ill patients. Therefore, primary hospitals were not included in the scope of the study The enrolled tertiary and secondary hospitals voluntar- ily participated and were selected by the China-NCCOC The selection criteria were as follows. (1) The ICU had to have more than five beds. (2) The ICU had to have the ability to diagnose and treat the relevant medical dis- eases that were evaluated as quality control items (such catheter- ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as related blood stream infections (CRBSIs), and catheter- associated urinary tract""

First., the use of secondary data limited essential variables such as the patient-level characteristics or uncontrolled confound- ers (e.g., education level of the staff. ICU bed occu- pancy rate) needed to understand the predictive factors of the patients' outcomes. To reduce these methodo- logical problems, we applied multivariate analysis using s adjusted for generalized linear mixed models patient disease severity using the APACHE I score, which has been shown to be an important predictor of patient outcomes [29, 30]. Second, since only one year of data was reported, presented and summarized in this study of the structural factors and health the relationships. outcomes could: not be analysed continuously anc dynamically. Third, this was an observational study and therefore, prone to selection bias. Causal relationships cannot be drawn due to the cross-sectional nature of the study design. Fourth, listwise deletion was used to data, which may cause bias in the handle the missing of the parameters 31 . Despite these limi- estimates tations, the results of this study are highly meaning- ful in that they underscore the necessity of nonpatient factors, including hospital and ICU structural factors, addi- as a way to reduce : adverse patient outcomes. In : tion, we have improved the generalizability of the find- ings by using national administrative data, unlike most data previous studies, which were conducted using from only certain regions or hospitals.

However, the data from China are scarce. This study was designed to investigate how differences in patient outcomes are associated with differences in hospital and ICU structure variables in China throughout 2019\n\nMethods: This was a multicenter observational study. Data from a total of 2820 hospitals were collected using the National Clinical lmprovement System Data that reports CU information in China. Data collection consisted of al information on the hospital and ICU structural factors, including the hospital type, number of beds, staffng, among others, and b) ICU patient outcomes, including the mortality rate as well as the incidence of ventilator-associated oneumonia (VAP). catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02%(3.78%, 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP CRBSL, and CAUT\n\npneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02% (3.78%., 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP. CRBSL, and CAUT were 5.58 (1.55.11.67) per 1000 ventilator davs., 0.63 (0.2.01) per 1000 catheter davs,and 142 (0.37,3,40) per 1000 catheter davs, respectively. Mortality was sianificantly lower in public hospitals (B= -0.018(- 0031.- 0.005) p=0.006), hospitals with an ICU-to-hospital bed percentage of more than 2% (B= -0.027 (-0.034,-0.019)., p<0.001) and higber in hospitals with a bed-to-nurse ratio of more than 0 5:1 (B=0009 (0 001 0017) np=0 027) The incidence of VAP was lower in public hospitals (B= -0.036 (- 0.054.-0018), p<0.001).

The context provided is a medical article about acute kidney injury (AKI) and its management. The article discusses the importance of early detection and prevention of AKI, as well as the role of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in treating AKI.

Regarding the question about the role of peripheral arterial catheterization (PAC) in severe COVID-19 patients, I couldn't find any specific information or evidence in the provided context. However, I can provide some general information about PAC in critically ill patients.

Peripheral arterial catheterization is a common technique used in critically ill patients to monitor blood pressure, obtain blood samples, and deliver medications. In patients with severe COVID-19, PAC may be used to:

1. Monitor blood pressure: PAC can help monitor blood pressure in patients with severe COVID-19, who may be at risk of developing hypertension or hypotension.
2. Obtain blood samples: PAC can be used to obtain blood samples for laboratory testing, such as blood cultures or coagulation studies.
3. Deliver medications: PAC can be used to deliver medications, such as vasopressors or inotropes, to patients with severe COVID-19.

However, the effectiveness of PAC in severe",[{'filename': '三级防护下超声引导外周动脉置管在新型冠状病毒肺炎重症患者中的应用.pdf'}],利用超声的可视化特性，采用平面外(短轴)技术联合平面内(长轴)技术对重症COVID-19患者进行外周动脉置管，可提高首次置管成功率，减少穿刺次数，降低穿刺并发症的发生率。,0.28053149773387737,0.4969603342570807,0.0

Several studies have been conducted to evaluate this effectiveness. One study by Ozcan et al. found that the incidence of CI-AKI was significantly lower in the bicarbonate group compared to the saline solution group. Another study by Recio-Mayoral et al. observed a lower incidence of CI-AKI in the bicarbonate group compared to the saline group, although mortality and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) did not significantly differ between the groups. Briguori et al. also found a lower incidence of CI-AKI in the bicarbonate/NAC group compared to the saline plus NAC group, but no significant difference was observed in mortality or the need for RRT among different treatment groups. However, a study by Maioli et al. did not find a significant difference in CI-AKI incidence between patients treated with sodium bicarbonate and those treated with saline. Overall, while some studies suggest that sodium bicarbonate may be more effective than saline, particularly when combined with NAC, others do not provide conclusive evidence, indicating that further research is needed to determine the optimal preventive medication for CI-AKI.",0.8167844644123042,0.7990927833766119,

While this heterogeneity provides insight into some susceptibility s populations, the factors that 1 across various are common setting to the generalizability c of results from one particular next is uncertain The course and outcome of AKI are modified by other factors, but since these are manifested within the context of actual disease, they must as""prognostic\' be categorized rather than ""risk"" factors, hence being discussed separately in Appendix D. Lastly, the fact that some 30% of patients whc increased risk of CKD recover from AKI remain cardiovascular disease, and death calls for the identification of the risk factors that can identify such patients in the hopes 50-52 of providing them with timely preventive measures Finally, it screen patients who have is important to undergone an exposure (e.g., sepsis, trauma) and to continue monitor high-risk patients until the risk has subsided. Exact intervals for checking and in which individuals to monitor urine output remain matters of clinical judgment: however, as a general rule, high risk in-patients should have SCr measured at least daily and  more frequently after exposure, and critically ill patients should have urine output monitoring. This will necessitate urinary bladder catheteriza- tion in many cases, and the risks of infection should also be considered in the monitoring plan. A recent clinical practice assessment in the UK concluded that only 50% of patients with AKI were considered to have received a""good"" overall standard of care. This figure fell to\n\nt over 30% if AKI developed during just hospital admission rather than being diagnosed before admission.53 The authors also felt that there n unacceptable delay in recognizing AKI in 43% that the those condition after developed that in a fifth of such n patients its develop admission, and ment was predictable and avoidable. Their recommendations for. of the initial AKI simple: risk were as assessment part evaluation of emergency admissions, along with appropriate biochemistry on admission and at frequent intervals serum thereafter.\n\n### RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n.

Definition and staging of AK] are based on the Risk, Injury, Failure; Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease (RIFLE) and Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria and studies on risk relationships. The treatment chapters cover oharmacological approaches to prevent or treat AKI, and management of renal replacement for kidney failure from AKI.

A recent study by Magder et al. compared 10% 250/0.45 HES to isotonic c saline in 262 patients ; who underwent cardiac surgery.100 These investigators tested whether fewer patients required Icatecholamines the morning after cardiac surgery (a chief determinant of ICU discharge) with HES compared to saline, and found indeed this the case (10.9% was VS 28.8%: P= 0.001). Importantly, the study found no evidence of nephrotoxicity: no difference in the daily creatinine, deve. lopment of AKI by RIFLE criteria during hospital stay (16% in both groups), or need for RRT (1% in each group) Importantly, patients in the saline group received nearly 60% more volume for fluid resuscitation in the ICU compared to HES (887 ys. 1397 ml: P<0 0001) While overall volume were small, advocates for colloid resuscitation will note that this is exactly the reason colloids are preferred for patients requiring large-volume resuscitation The tonicity of colloid preparations may also vary by t meta-analysis described 11 randomized agent. A recent trials s with a total of 1220 patients: seven evaluating albumin and hyperoncotic four evaluating hyperoncotie starch. Hyperoncotic albumin decreased the odds of AKI by 76% while hyperoncotic starch increased those odds by 92% (odds ratio [OR] 1,92: CI 1.31-2.81: P= 0.0008). Paralle effects on mortality were observed. This meta-analysis con cluded that the renal effects of hyperoncotic colloid solution appear to be colloid-specific, with displaying  albumin renoprotection and hyperoncotic starch showing nephro- toxicity. A 7000-patient study comparing 6% HES 130/0.4 in saline with saline alone was scheduled to begin in Australia and New Zealand in 2010. This study will provide further high-quality data to help guide clinical practice 102 Thus, the use of isotonic saline as the standard of care for intravascular volume expansion to prevent or treat AKl is based upon the lack of clear evidence that colloids s are superior for this purpose, along  with some evidence that specifc colloids may cause Akl, in addition to hgher costs. T is acknowledged that colloids may be chosen in some patient: to aid in reaching resuscitation goals, or to avoid excessive fluid administration in patients requiring  volume g large resuscitation, or in specific patient subsets (e.g., a cirrhotic patient with spontaneous peritonitis, or in burns). Similarly although hypotonic or hypertonic crystalloids may be used in specific clinical the choice of crystalloic with scenarios, altered tonicity is generally dictated by: goals other than intravascular volume or expansion (e.g., hypernatremia nyponatremia). One of the concerns with isotonic saline is that this contains 154 mmol/l chloride and  that solution administration in large volumes s will result in relative 01 absolute hyperchloremia (for a review, see Kaplan et al.103) Although direct proof of harm arising from saline-induced hyperchloremia is lacking, buffered salt solutions approxi mate physiological chloride concentrations and their admin istration  less likely to acid-base disturbances cause Whether use of buffered solutions results in better outcome: is, however, uncertain\n\n### VASOPRESSORS\n\n3.1.2: We recommend the use of vasopressors in conjunc- tion with fluids in patients with vasomotor shock with, or at risk for, AKI.

This benefit should be ap-\n\nment of intravascular support (110). On the basis of a number of studies, it is accepted tha aggressive fluid resuscitation with crvstalloid colloids is of fundamental importance to survival of septic shock in children (111. 112) There is only one randomized, controlled tria comparing the use of colloid to crvstalloic resuscitation (dextran gelatin, lactated Ring er's solution, or saline) in children with den gue shock (111) All these children survived regardless of the fluid used but the longes time to recovery from shock occurred in chil dren who received lactated Ringer's solution Among patients with the narrowest pulse pres sure there was a suggestion that colloids wer effective than crvstalloids in restorins more normal pulse pressure Fluid infusion is bes initiated with boluses of 20 mL /ks over 5-10 mins titrated to clinical monitors of cardiae output including heart rate urine outnut capillary refill I and level of consciousness Children normally have a lower blood pressure than adults and prevent reduction in blood pressure by vasoconstrictior and in creasing heart rate Therefore blood pressu by itself is not a reliable end point for assess ing the adequacy of resuscitation, However once hvpotension occurs. cardiovascular col lanse may soon follow Henatomegaly occurs in children who are fluid overloaded and car be a helpful sign of the adequacy of fluic resuscitation.""]",什么是透析导管的正确位置，以及为什么正确放置是重要的？,negative_rejection,29," The correct position of the dialysis catheter is crucial for effective dialysis and to prevent complications. According to the context, the correct position of the dialysis catheter is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the dialysis catheter should be placed in a location that allows for optimal blood flow and minimizes the risk of complications. The correct position of the dialysis catheter is important because it can affect the efficiency of dialysis, the risk of complications such as bleeding, and the overall outcome of the patient.

A fluid challenge is a process of administering a controlled amount of fluid to a patient with suspected or confirmed sepsis, typically in the form of crystalloids or colloids, to assess the patient's response to fluid resuscitation. The goal of a fluid challenge is to determine whether the patient's hypovolemia is responsive to fluid administration, and if so, to guide further fluid management.

In the context of acute sepsis, a fluid challenge is often performed to:

1. Assess the patient's volume status: Fluid challenge helps to determine whether the patient's hypovolemia is due to fluid loss or inadequate fluid administration.
2. Guide fluid resuscitation: Based on the patient's response to the fluid challenge, clinicians can adjust fluid administration to optimize volume status and prevent over-resuscitation.
3. Monitor organ perfusion: Fluid challenge can help assess the adequacy of organ perfusion, such as cardiac output, renal function, and cerebral perfusion.

The fluid challenge process typically involves the following steps:

1. Initial fluid administration: A controlled amount of fluid (usually 500-1000 mL of crystalloids or 300-500 mL of colloids) is administered over a short period",[{'filename': '2004+SSC+严重脓毒症与脓毒性休克治疗国际指南.pdf'}],"A fluid challenge is an initial volume expansion period where the response of the patient to fluid administration is carefully evaluated. During this process, large amounts of fluids may be administered over a short period under close monitoring to evaluate the patient's response and avoid the development of edema. In the management of acute sepsis, fluid challenge helps in assessing the patient's response to fluid administration and guides further fluid resuscitation. It is crucial for evaluating the patient's hemodynamic status and ensuring adequate perfusion, especially during the first 24 hours of management when aggressive fluid resuscitation is often necessary. Input/output ratios are not useful during this period. Instead, the focus is on closely monitoring the patient's response to fluid administration to maintain adequate perfusion and prevent complications such as pulmonary edema.",0.3474405328957868,0.45619980951684963,0.5

On the basis of a number of studies, it is accepted tha aggressive fluid resuscitation with crvstalloid colloids is of fundamental importance to survival of septic shock in children (111. 112) There is only one randomized, controlled tria comparing the use of colloid to crvstalloic resuscitation (dextran gelatin, lactated Ring er's solution, or saline) in children with den gue shock (111) All these children survived regardless of the fluid used but the longes time to recovery from shock occurred in chil dren who received lactated Ringer's solution Among patients with the narrowest pulse pres sure there was a suggestion that colloids wer effective than crvstalloids in restorins more normal pulse pressure Fluid infusion is bes initiated with boluses of 20 mL /ks over 5-10 mins titrated to clinical monitors of cardiae output including heart rate urine outnut capillary refill I and level of consciousness Children normally have a lower blood pressure than adults and prevent reduction in blood pressure by vasoconstrictior and in creasing heart rate Therefore blood pressu by itself is not a reliable end point for assess ing the adequacy of resuscitation, However once hvpotension occurs. cardiovascular col lanse may soon follow Henatomegaly occurs in children who are fluid overloaded and car be a helpful sign of the adequacy of fluic resuscitation.""

Continuous infusion may help to avoid this peak effect and detectable blood glucose levels. Additionally, there is considerable inter-individual variability in this peak effect, making it challenging to predict and manage.

Several factors, including ICU struc ture, ICU organization and d the care process, can influ ence ICU 1 extensive performance 1-3]. Despite the ICUs, the the quality of care literature addressing impact of such factors remains controversial, and a dili. gent assessment of care components is required It is well known that ICU structural factors vary within and regions [4, 51. However, most different countries related conducted in Western studies have been coun- tries [6. 71. Little evidence regarding the structural factors of ICUs in China is available [81, China still faces chal lenges in providing optimal and equitable management strategies for ICU patients across the nation because its broad geography and unbalanced economic develop ment. A previous study described critical care resources in Guangdong Province 9. Another study evaluated the practices, outcomes, and costs related to mechanical ven: tilation within ICUs in Beijing [10]. Nonetheless, those studies were limited to the regions in which the surveys were administered and feature small e sizes: it is I sample also not clear whether those resources were e associated with ICU care provision, treatment patterns, and patient demands outcomes. Finally, increasing  and I rising costs significant challenges to the delivery of high-qual pose: ity and affordable critical care to a growing population of patients. Optimizing ICU organization is a potentia opportunity to improve patient outcomes and the use of resources. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate hos- pital and ICU structural factors and patient outcomes in China. Moreover, we aimed to identify the associa- tion between these variables and patient outcomes, with structural factors, including ICU a focus on potential structural resources and staffing levels. We hypothesized that patients admitted to hospitals that were government- funded, tertiary, well-equipped, and better-staffed woulc have a decreased risk of ICU mortality and occurrence of VAP, CRBSIs and CAUTIs after adjusting for region, dis ease severity, and other confounders.\n\nDesign This nationwide, database observational e study was a National Clinical 2019.

Hospitals in China are classified in a 3-tier svstem (primary, second arvy or tertiary hospital) that recognizes a hospital's ability to provide medical care, medical education, and conduct medical research. Tertiary hospitals, similar to a tertiary referral hospital in the West, are usually comprehen- sive, referral, general hospitals responsible for provid- ing specialist health services, perform a larger role with 1 and scientific research regard to medical education and serve as medical hubs providing care to multiple regions Secondary hospitals, similar to : a regional hospital e district hospital in the West, tend to be affiliated with medium-sized city, county, or district and are responsible for providing comprehensive health services and medical education and conducting research on a regional basis. Ir contrast, primary hospitals are primary health care insti- tutions whose main function is to provide primary pre- vention directly to the population, however, they rarely admit and treat critically ill patients. Therefore, primary hospitals were not included in the scope of the study The enrolled tertiary and secondary hospitals voluntar- ily participated and were selected by the China-NCCOC The selection criteria were as follows.

However, the data from China are scarce. This study was designed to investigate how differences in patient outcomes are associated with differences in hospital and ICU structure variables in China throughout 2019\n\nMethods: This was a multicenter observational study. Data from a total of 2820 hospitals were collected using the National Clinical lmprovement System Data that reports CU information in China. Data collection consisted of al information on the hospital and ICU structural factors, including the hospital type, number of beds, staffng, among others, and b) ICU patient outcomes, including the mortality rate as well as the incidence of ventilator-associated oneumonia (VAP). catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02%(3.78%, 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP CRBSL, and CAUT\n\npneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02% (3.78%., 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP.

"["" more advanced study. needed design and analytical approach examine the dynamic impact of nurse staffing on ICU patient outcomes There are some limitations to this study. First., the use of secondary data limited essential variables such as the patient-level characteristics or uncontrolled confound- ers (e.g., education level of the staff. ICU bed occu- pancy rate) needed to understand the predictive factors of the patients' outcomes. To reduce these methodo- logical problems, we applied multivariate analysis using s adjusted for generalized linear mixed models patient disease severity using the APACHE I score, which has been shown to be an important predictor of patient outcomes [29, 30]. Second, since only one year of data was reported, presented and summarized in this study of the structural factors and health the relationships. outcomes could: not be analysed continuously anc dynamically. Third, this was an observational study and therefore, prone to selection bias. Causal relationships cannot be drawn due to the cross-sectional nature of the study design. Fourth, listwise deletion was used to data, which may cause bias in the handle the missing of the parameters 31 . Despite these limi- estimates tations, the results of this study are highly meaning- ful in that they underscore the necessity of nonpatient factors, including hospital and ICU structural factors, addi- as a way to reduce : adverse patient outcomes. In : tion, we have improved the generalizability of the find- ings by using national administrative data, unlike most data previous studies, which were conducted using from only certain regions or hospitals. The results may have important implications for critical care develop ment in China and other countries with similar medica environments.\n\nIn conclusion, specific structural factors, includingl hos- pital ownership, hospital type, I ICU-hospital bed percent: with ICU and bed-to-nurse associated e ratio age, were 1 poli- These observations can patient 1 assist in toutcomes. the cies and interventions bridge current quality gap in the delivery of critical care in China well as other developing countries.\n\nVAP: Ventilator-associated pneumonia; CRBSls: Catheter-related blood stream infections; CAUTls: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections: APACHE I score: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score; IQR: Interquartile range;95% Cl: Confidence interval; ICU: Intensive care unit\n\n### Supplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi. org/10.1186/s13054-022-03892-7.\n\nAdditional fle 1.

First., the use of secondary data limited essential variables such as the patient-level characteristics or uncontrolled confound- ers (e.g., education level of the staff. ICU bed occu- pancy rate) needed to understand the predictive factors of the patients' outcomes. To reduce these methodo- logical problems, we applied multivariate analysis using s adjusted for generalized linear mixed models patient disease severity using the APACHE I score, which has been shown to be an important predictor of patient outcomes [29, 30]. Second, since only one year of data was reported, presented and summarized in this study of the structural factors and health the relationships. outcomes could: not be analysed continuously anc dynamically. Third, this was an observational study and therefore, prone to selection bias. Causal relationships cannot be drawn due to the cross-sectional nature of the study design. Fourth, listwise deletion was used to data, which may cause bias in the handle the missing of the parameters 31 . Despite these limi- estimates tations, the results of this study are highly meaning- ful in that they underscore the necessity of nonpatient factors, including hospital and ICU structural factors, addi- as a way to reduce : adverse patient outcomes.

However, the data from China are scarce. This study was designed to investigate how differences in patient outcomes are associated with differences in hospital and ICU structure variables in China throughout 2019\n\nMethods: This was a multicenter observational study. Data from a total of 2820 hospitals were collected using the National Clinical lmprovement System Data that reports CU information in China. Data collection consisted of al information on the hospital and ICU structural factors, including the hospital type, number of beds, staffng, among others, and b) ICU patient outcomes, including the mortality rate as well as the incidence of ventilator-associated oneumonia (VAP). catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02%(3.78%, 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP CRBSL, and CAUT\n\npneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSls), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTls), Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse the association between hospital and ICU structura factors and patient outcomes Results: The median ICU patient mortality was 8.02% (3.78%., 14.35%), and the incidences of VAP.

1. Blood vessel active drugs, such as dopamine and dobutamine, can increase blood pressure and improve blood flow, which can help to restore blood circulation and reduce the risk of organ failure in patients with septic shock.
2. Blood vessel active drugs can also help to improve cardiac function, increase cardiac output, and reduce the risk of arrhythmias.
3. In addition, blood vessel active drugs can help to reduce the production of inflammatory mediators and improve immune function, which can help to reduce the severity of septic shock.

Overall, blood vessel active drugs play an important role in the treatment of septic shock, and can help to improve outcomes for patients with this condition. [1]

 ' Evidence Table.\n\nIn one study, the observation of a potential Rationale. interaction between steroid use and ACTH test was not statistically significant [1751.

Cortisol immunoassays may actual cortisol level, affecting over- or underestimate the assignment of patients to responders or nonresponders\n\n[184]. Although the clinical significance is not clear, it is now recognized that etomidate, when used for induction for intubation, will suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis [185. 186]. Moreover, a  subanalysis of the CORTICUS trial [178] revealed that the use of etomidate before application of low-dose steroids was associated with an increased 28-day [187]. An inap- mortality rate propriately low random cortisol level (<18 ug/dL) in patient with shock would be considered an indication for traditional adrenal insufficiency steroid therapy a along guidelines.\n\nRationale. There has been e study comparative between a fixed-duration and clinically guided regimen or between tapering and abrupt cessation of steroids. Three RCTs used a fixed-duration protocol for treatment [175. 177, 178], and therapy decreased after shock reso- was  RCTs [176. 1821.

We recommend that corticosteroids not t be adminis-\n\nRationale. Steroids may be indicated in the presence of steroid therapy or adrenal dysfunction, but a history whether low-dose steroids have preventive potency in reducing the incidence of severe sepsis and septic shock in critically ill patients cannot be answered. A preliminary study of stress-dose level steroids in community-acquired pneumonia showed improved  measures in outcome ✓ RCT population [190], and a recent confirmatory small1 revealed reduced hospital length of stay without affecting mortality [191]. 5.

Several randomized trials on the use of low-n patients revealed a dose hydrocortisone in septic shock significant increase of hyperglycemia and hypernatremia [1751 as side effects, A small prospective e study demon- strated that repetitive bolus application of hydrocortisone leads to a significant increase in blood glucose; this peak\n\neffect was g continuous infusion. during detectable Furthermore, considerable inter-individual variability was seen in this blood g peak after the hydrocortisone glucose bolus [192].

Several factors, including ICU struc ture, ICU organization and d the care process, can influ ence ICU 1 extensive performance 1-3]. Despite the ICUs, the the quality of care literature addressing impact of such factors remains controversial, and a dili. gent assessment of care components is required It is well known that ICU structural factors vary within and regions [4, 51. However, most different countries related conducted in Western studies have been coun- tries [6. 71. Little evidence regarding the structural factors of ICUs in China is available [81, China still faces chal lenges in providing optimal and equitable management strategies for ICU patients across the nation because its broad geography and unbalanced economic develop ment. A previous study described critical care resources in Guangdong Province 9. Another study evaluated the practices, outcomes, and costs related to mechanical ven: tilation within ICUs in Beijing [10]. Nonetheless, those studies were limited to the regions in which the surveys were administered and feature small e sizes: it is I sample also not clear whether those resources were e associated with ICU care provision, treatment patterns, and patient demands outcomes. Finally, increasing  and I rising costs significant challenges to the delivery of high-qual pose: ity and affordable critical care to a growing population of patients. Optimizing ICU organization is a potentia opportunity to improve patient outcomes and the use of resources. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate hos- pital and ICU structural factors and patient outcomes in China. Moreover, we aimed to identify the associa- tion between these variables and patient outcomes, with structural factors, including ICU a focus on potential structural resources and staffing levels. We hypothesized that patients admitted to hospitals that were government- funded, tertiary, well-equipped, and better-staffed woulc have a decreased risk of ICU mortality and occurrence of VAP, CRBSIs and CAUTIs after adjusting for region, dis ease severity, and other confounders.\n\nDesign This nationwide, database observational e study was a National Clinical 2019.

```
The meta-analysis results suggest that loop diuretics, particularly furosemide, do not reduce mortality or the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) in acute kidney injury (AKI) patients. High-dose furosemide administration (>1 g/d) may cause ototoxicity, with a relative risk (RR) of 3.97 (95% CI 1.00-15.78; P=0.05). Prophylactic use of diuretics to prevent AKI may actually increase AKI incidence, raising concerns regarding their use in any setting.

Regarding the prophylactic use of diuretics in hemodynamically stable lung injury and ventilation strategies, there is limited evidence to support their use. Two recent studies have investigated the administration of furosemide to patients treated with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), but did not find a beneficial effect on renal recovery or the discontinuation of renal replacement therapy.

Mannitol has been historically used to prevent AKI, particularly in patients undergoing surgery. However, its effectiveness is uncertain, and it may not convey additional beneficial effects beyond adequate hydration. In radiocontrast-induced nephropathy, mannitol may exacerbate the condition","[{'filename': 'Sievert-2013-Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.pdf'}

"['When selecting a vein for insertion dialysis in patients with AKI, the preference for catheter placement would be: First choice: left jugular vein; Second choice: femoral vein; Third choice: right jugular vein; Last choice: subclavian vein with preference for the non-dominant side.\n\nAlthough generally associated with the lowest rate of infectious complications, the CDC guideline as well as the KDOQI guideline recommend avoiding the right jugular vein for RRT access. This recommendation is mainly derived from observational data in ESRD patients showing a higher incidence of central vein stenosis with right jugular than with subclavian dialysis catheters. On the other hand, central vein stenosis has also been described after subclavian catheterization. The contact of the catheter with the vessel wall is considered a primary initiating event for catheter-related thrombosis and stenosis. Catheters in the left internal jugular vein have a straight course into the left brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava, and, therefore, the least contact with the vessel wall. A catheter inserted through the right subclavian or the right jugular vein has one or more angulations, explaining the higher risk of vessel contact and thrombosis/stenosis with right-sided compared to left jugular catheters. The right jugular vein should, therefore, be considered the last choice for insertion of a dialysis catheter in patients with AKI, especially when the risk of nonrecovery of kidney function is substantial. Whether this recommendation should be extended to the right jugular vein remains unclear. In patients where the right jugular vein remains the only available option, preference should be given to the non-dominant side in order to spare the dominant side for eventual future permanent access. Because the right jugular vein should be avoided, the remaining options are the left jugular and femoral veins. The use of femoral catheters is thought to be associated with the highest risk of infection, and avoidance of femoral lines is part of many ""central line bundles"" that intend to reduce the incidence of bloodstream catheter-related infections. This dogma was questioned in a concealed, randomized multicenter, evaluator-blinded, parallel-group trial of 750 AKI patients, comparing the femoral with the left jugular site for first catheter insertion for RRT. Ultrasound was seldom used probably explaining the somewhat higher rate of failure on one side and crossover in the left jugular group. The rate of hematoma formation was also higher in the left jugular group. In both groups, 20% of the catheters were impregnated with antiseptic. The mean duration of catheterization was 6.2 days for the femoral and 6.9 days for the left jugular group. The major reasons for catheter removal were no longer required or death. The incidence of catheter colonization at removal did not significantly differ between the femoral and left jugular group. When stratified according to body mass index (BMI), those within the lowest BMI tertile had a higher incidence of colonization with the left jugular site, whereas those within the highest BMI tertile had the highest colonization rate with femoral catheters. Bloodstream infection did not differ between the groups (2.3 per 1000 catheter-days for left jugular and 1.5 per 1000 catheter-days for femoral) but the study was not powered for this point. This was also the case for thrombotic complications. Malfunction is another issue that needs to be considered when choosing between left jugular and femoral access. Observational trials show more malfunctioning and a shorter actuarial survival for femoral than for left jugular dialysis.']",选择适合的静脉进行透析导管插入时，为什么右锁骨上静脉是首选而不是颈内静脉或腘静脉？,counter_factual,53,"The right jugular vein should be considered the last choice for insertion of a dialysis catheter in patients with AKI, especially when the risk of nonrecovery of kidney function is substantial.

The patients in the bicarbonate s group had more severe rena disease with higher baseline SCr (1.58 + 0.5 mg/dl: 140 + 44.2 umol/1) vs. (1.28 + 0.3 mg/dl; 113 + 26.5 umol/1) P= 0.001 and a lower eGFR., compared to the normal saline group. After contrast-media exposure, there was significant drop in eGFR (6.4%) and increase in SCr (11.3%) in the normal saline group significant change in the bicarbonate group. Three patients (3.4%) in the bicarbonate group, as opposed to 14 patients (14.3%) in the normal saline group, developed CI-AKI (P= 0.011).

This needed study suggests that : the use of i.v sodium bicarbonate is more o effective than normal saline in preventing CI-AKI Three studies compared bicarbonate and saline solutions associated with the administration of NAC in both stud arms.486-488 Recio-Mayoral et al 488 conducted a prospective single-center RCT in 11l consecutive patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing emergency angioplasty. One group of patients received an infusion of sodium bicarbonate plus NAC started just before contrast-media injection 1 and continued for 12 hours after angioplasty. The second (control) group received the standard fluid protocol consist ing of i.v. isotonic saline for 12 hours after angioplasty. In both groups, two doses of oral NAC were administered the next day. A SCr concentration 1 >0.5 mg/dl (>44.2 umol/1 from baseline after emergency angioplasty was observed in 1.8% in the bicarbonate group and in 21.8% of the saline group. Mortality and need for RRT were not significanth different between both groups. Briguori et al 48e randomized 326 CKD patients (SCr >2mg/dl>177 umol/1 and/or eGFR <40 ml/min per 1.73 m ), and referred for coronary and/or peripheral I procedures to three different protocols\n\nprophylactic administration of 0.9% e infusion n plus saline NAC NAC (n= 111). sodium bicarbonate infusion 1 plus ascorbic acid H plus NAC (n= 108), and 0.9% saline plus (n= 107).

The initial SSC guidelines were published in 2004 [8] and incorporated the evidence available through the end of 2003. The 2008 publication analyzed evidence available through the end of 2007. The most current iteration is based on updated literature search incorporated into the evolving manuscript through fall 2012.\n\nThe selection of committee members was based on interest and expertise in specific aspects of sepsis. Co-chairs and the executive committee appointed e members were Society of Critical Care Medicine and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine governing bodies. Each sponsor- ing organization appointed a representative who had sepsis expertise. Additional committee members were a appointed by the co-chairs and executive committee to create conti nuity with the previous committees\' membership as well as\n\nto address content needs for the development process.

Several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals occurred major 1 international meetings nominal groups). with work continuing via teleconferences and electronic-based discussions among subgroups and members of the entire committee. Ultimately, a meeting of all group heads, executive committee members, and other key committee members was held to finalize the draft doc- ument for submission to reviewers.\n\n### Search techniques\n\nA separate literature search was performed for each clearly defined question. The committee chairs worked with sub. group heads to identify pertinent search terms that were to include, at a minimum, sepsis, severe s sepsis, septic shock and sepsis syndrome crossed against the subgroup\'s general topic area, as well as appropriate key words of the specific question posed.

The this e methods for document build on a 2001 publication spon- sored by the International Sepsis Forum and use the same method of grading recommen. dations (4). The supplement submission wil include background material, questions posed that led to the recommendation, and expanded rationale. This executive summary is targeted to be concise and user friendly for the bedside clinician, The 2001 publication that was s used as a starting point for current : process included a MEDLINE search for clinical trials in the preceding 10 vrs. supplemented by manual search of other relevant journals, Sub topics for each recommendation were cross referenced to sepsis, septic sepsis, severe shock. sepsis syndrome, and infection. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines consid ered the in the 2001 evidence 1 publication (through 1999) and repeated the process for 2000 through 2003. The committee process began in June 2003 with a meeting featuring the first presentations of data and recommen dations. Recommendations discussed were and critiqued. Each clinical trial used to sup port recommendations was graded based lor the methodology in Table 1 and included pres- ence or absence of important elements such as concealed randomization, blinded outcome adjudication, intention to treat analysis, and explicit definition of primary outcome. All ar- v reviewed ticles were initially based on sub- group assignments and d typically by  two on three participants. Survival (28-30 days) was the standard outcome measure used to assess outcome benefit, and when an alternative was used this is the rationale. Where $ stated in strong trial evidence existed for outcome ben- efit in critically ill populations known to con tain a larger number of sepsis patients, these trials were considered in determination of rec ommendation grading. A strict evidence-based methodology with a scoring system was\n\nused. The goal was total consensus, which wa: reached in all recommendations except two. In those circumstances (recommendations C3 ang H1), the solution was achieved with the inclu subrecommendations that expressed some difference in expert opinion, When there difference of opinion was 1about grading clinical trial, an outside epidemiologist was con sulted This occurred in one circumstance with resolution of differences. Each participant com pleted a conflict of interest form, and individual: were not assigned to a subgroup topic if they had a potential conflict of interest. A full listing of al potential conflicts of interest is included with this article. Following that meeting. the process continued with o further refinement t of recom mendations through electronic communicatior among committee members. A second meeting of core members of the committee occurred inr early October 2003. The document was finalized and approved by the consensus committee and by sponsoring organizations in December 2003 Evidence-based anproaches more readily applied to data from therapeutic trials 1 of diagnostic techniques is less Evaluation well suited to this approach. Readers will note that the maiority of the recommendations ar nof supported by high-level evidence. Most are supported by expert opinion only. In order fo a general recommendation to carry a higher level of evidence (grades A. B. C. or D). a supporting study or studies must have shown a clinical outcome difference. Studies showing physiologic changes that could be potential sur of clinical outcome benefit were rogates e not used by themselves as pivotal studies but were used to support the validity of studies showing an outcome in a clinically important variable such as survival or length of ICU stay.

Methods: We used a modified Delphi methodology for grading recommendations. built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.\n\nKey recommendations, listed by category and not by Results: K hierarchy, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition; appropriate diagnostic studies to ascertain causative organisms before starting antibiotics: early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy: reassess ment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to a usual 7-10 days of antibiotic narrow coverage, when appropriate; therapy guided by clinical response; source control with attention to the method that balances risks and benefits: equivalence of crystal loid and colloid resuscitation; aggressive fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure; vasopressor preference for norepi- nephrine and dopamine; cautious use of vasopressin pending further studies: avoiding low-dose dopamine administration for renal protec- tion; consideration of dobutamine inotropic therapy in some clinical situations; avoidance of supranormal oxygen delivery as a goal of therapy; stress-dose steroid therapy for septic shock; use of recom- binant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and high risk\n\nfor death: with resolution of tissue hypoperfusion and in the absence of coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage, targeting a hemoglobin of 7-9 a/dL: appropriate use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets; a low tidal volume and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome: application of ressure in acute lung a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory nr distress svndrome: a semirecumbent bed posi- iniurv/acute respiratory r tion unless contraindicated: protocols for weaning and sedation/analge sia. using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion dation with daily interruptions/lightening: avoidance of neuromuscular <150mg/dl blockers. if at all possible: maintenance of blood glucose after initial stabilization: equivalence of continuous veno-veno hemofil- tration and intermittent hemodialysis: lack of utility of bicarbonate use for pH ≥7.15: use of deep vein thrombosis/stress ulcer prophylaxis; and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate. Pediatric con- siderations included a more likely need for intubation due to low func tional residual capacity; more difficult intravenous access: fluid resus citation based on weight with 40-60 mL/kg or higher needed; decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance as the most common hemodynamic profile; greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points: unsettled issue of high-dose steroids for therapy with aggressive of septic shock: and greater risk of hypoglycemia qlucose control. Conclusion: Evidence-based recommendations can be made re garding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that are hoped to translate into improved outcomes for critically ill patient. The impact of these quidelines will be formally tested and quidelines updated annually and d even more rapidly some important new knowledge becomes available.

The context describes the evolution of ECMO technology, from its early beginnings to its current widespread use in treating severe respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock. It highlights the challenges faced in China, including insufficient differences, centre cases, regional construction, and related technical issues.

To answer the question, I'll summarize the key points:

1. ECMO technology has evolved from being a high-tech weapon with high mortality to a life-saving weapon, widely used in the treatment of patients with severe respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock.
2. In China, ECMO's role in treating severe respiratory failure has evolved significantly, with a rapid increase in the number of ECMO centers and patients treated.
3. However, despite this progress, there are still challenges faced in China, including insufficient differences, centre cases, regional construction, and related technical issues.
4. The context also mentions the importance of ECMO in treating patients with severe respiratory failure, citing a survival rate of 54.5% for adult patients and 51.6% for patients with respiratory failure.

Based on this information, I would answer the question as follows:

How do these criteria influence clinical practice and patient outcomes per KDIGO guidelines? Lastly, how does the approach incorporate evidence-based methods and interdisciplinary collaboration?",multi_context,65," I'd be happy to help you with that!

According to the KDIGO guidelines, RIFLE/AKIN criteria define kidney injuries based on changes in serum creatinine (SCr) and urine output. The criteria are used to classify patients into three stages: Risk (R), Injury (I), and Failure (F). The RIFLE criteria were developed to predict the risk of mortality and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI).

The RIFLE/AKIN criteria influence clinical practice by:

1. Identifying patients at risk of AKI and allowing for early intervention to prevent progression to more severe stages.
2. Guiding treatment decisions, such as the need for RRT, based on the stage of AKI.
3. Facilitating communication among healthcare providers about the severity of AKI and the need for coordinated care.

The KDIGO guidelines incorporate evidence-based methods by:

1. Conducting a comprehensive review of the literature to inform the development of the guidelines.
2. Using a rigorous methodology to evaluate the evidence and develop recommendations.
3. Incorporating input from international experts in the field of nephrology and critical care medicine.

The approach also emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration by:

We were to review medical records of 21,191 admissions (94.0%). The reasons for not reviewing the rest 1,361 cases included missing medical records (n = 277) and rejection of application by the hospital (n = 1,084). Of the 21,191 hospitalizations investigated, median age was 9,431 66 years, e male, 13,304 patients patients (44.5%) were median Charlson (62,8%) medical admissions, and were comorbidity index was 1 (IOR,0-2).\n\n### Characteristics of Patients With Sepsis\n\nWe identified 1,716 patients with sepsis.

However, these standing the national burden of the clinical I syndrome, allo- cating limited healthcare resources, benchmarking the quality of healthcare delivery, and prioritizing research budgets (1). Ir addition, given the high occurrence rate and mortality of sepsis reported in our study, potential strategies for the prevention of sepsis should be proactively investigated, which might include but not limited to, vaccination in vulnerable population implementation of infection prevention programs mainly tar- geting nosocomial infections, promotion of increased aware- of sepsis as general ness s among healthcare providers s as well public, and development of real-time sepsis s screening system as a priority. Our study is s subject to other limitations. First, the retro- spective nature of our study might compromise the credibility of our results, However, we tried to capture every septic case by reviewing medical records of all hospitalized patients dur- ing the study period, which might be more reliable than using administrative data (32). Second, the occurrence rate of sepsis might be underestimated in our study, because e some patients might seek for medical care in military or private hospitals\n\nwhich were not included in our database. Nevertheless, the number of these patients was presumed to be very small due to reimbursement policy. Third, the reported mortality was rate all-cause estimate rather than attributable mortality rate. In fact, without a case-control design, it would be impossible to estimate the contributable mortality in a cohort study. Fourth the microbiologic data reported in this retrospective cohort study might be biased in favor of nosocomial bacterial patho- gens, due to lack of consistent sepsis workup o across all hospi and perception of well-established microbiology in most tals, community-acquired infections.

Considering the fact that China the disease burden of sepsis is stepping into o an aging society, expected to increase in the future. Given the importance of sepsis as a public health problem, prospective studies should be performed to confirm our findings, as well as to delineate the associated cost of care and long-term outcome.\n\n### REFERENCES 1Bone RC Balk RA\n\n1.

How do these factors influence patient outcomes and resource allocation, especially in Yuetan Subdistrict, Beijing's aging population?",multi_context,66," I'd be happy to help you with that! 

According to the context, the prevalence rates of sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock in Yuetan Subdistrict, Beijing were 667, 103, and 91 cases per 100,000 population per year, respectively. The prevalence rates increased with age, with the highest rates observed in the elderly population (>90 years old). 

Gender disparities were also observed, with men having a higher prevalence rate of sepsis and septic shock compared to women. 

Regarding seasonal variations, the occurrence rate of sepsis exhibited a slow but steady increase since adolescence, with the highest rates observed in winter. 

These factors can influence patient outcomes and resource allocation in several ways: 

1. Increased prevalence rates in the elderly population may lead to a higher burden on healthcare resources, particularly in terms of hospital admissions and ICU care. 
2. Gender disparities may require targeted interventions to address the unique needs and outcomes of men and women with sepsis. 
3. Seasonal variations may inform strategies for preventing sepsis, such as vaccination campaigns during peak winter months or targeted infection prevention programs during summer months.

Furthermore, CKD and AKI may coexist all available clinical o using 1 (laboratory, imaging data history, and physical exam) it should be possible to o arrive at both an accurate diagnosis as well as an accurate estimate of baseline SCr. Importantly, excluding some cases of hemo- I resuscitation (discussed dilution secondary to massive f fuid below), the lowest SCr obtained during a hospitalization or greater than the baseline. This SCr usually e should be used to diagnose (and stage) AKI. For example, if no baseline SCr was available in Case A, diagnosis of AKI could be made using the MDRD estimated SCr (Table 9). If Case A were a 70-year-old white female with no evidence or of CKD, the baseline SCr would be 0.8 mg/dl history (71 umol/l) and a of AKI would be possible a diagnosis 1 day 1 (criterion 1, ≥50% increase from 1 baseline). on However, if the patient male, his was a 20-year-old black bpaseline SCr would be estimated 1 at 1.5 mg/dl (133 umol/1). s admission SCr is lower, this is assumed to be the Since his baseline SCr until day 7 when he returns to his true baseline, and this value can be taken as the baseline. These dynamic in interpretation changes seen in epidemiologic not studies, which 1 are conducted when all the data are present, but are in clinical medicine. Note that the only common n way to diagnose AKI (by SCr criteria) in Case H is to use an estimated SCr.\n\n### Examples of application of AKI stages\n\nOnce a diagnosis of AKI has been made, the next step is to 2.1.2).

For example, case A can be diagnosed with AKIo on day 2 by the first criterion, whereas the second criterion until 1is not satisfied increase from 1.3 to 1.9). However, this is only true because the episode of AKI began prior to medical attention, and thus the day 1 SCr level increased. If creatinine already measurements had available with 48 hours prior to day 1 and if this level had been at baseline (1.0 mg/dl [88.4 umol/11), it would have been possible to diagnose AKI on day 1 using the second criterion not have a baseline measurement of SCr Cases F-H do available.

Explanation: According to the context, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation can be used to estimate baseline serum creatinine (SCr) levels. This approach has been used in many studies and has been validated. The estimated SCr levels can be used to diagnose AKI, especially when there is no available baseline SCr measurement. However, the accuracy of the estimated SCr levels may be affected by factors such as race, age, and sex, which are not mentioned in the context.

Note: The answer is 1 because the information about estimating baseline SCr levels using the MDRD equation is present in the context. The answer would be -1 if the information was not present in the context.","[{'filename': 'Sievert-2013-Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.pdf'}

This estimation helps in determining a reference SCr for staging AKI. If a patient's actual baseline SCr is unknown, the MDRD estimated SCr can be used to diagnose AKI. For example, if a patient has no evidence of CKD and their baseline SCr is estimated at 0.8 mg/dl (71 umol/l), an AKI diagnosis can be made if there is a ≥50% increase from this baseline. Similarly, if a patient's baseline SCr is estimated at 1.5 mg/dl (133 umol/l), a return to this value after an episode of AKI indicates recovery.

Such ""double expression would also facilitate comparison between different studies on epidemiology and prognosis of CI-AKI. It is well known that, when measuring the plasma clearance of a GFR marker (e.g., with the contrast medium fohexol), the AUC is directly related to the dose of iohexol and inversely related to the GFR. Thus, by mathematically the AUC estimating and knowing the injected iodine AUC. Thus, dose, the GER can be calculated by dose AUC= dose - GFR, and AUC i directly related to the systemic exposure of a drug, including the contrast medium which, in with its efficacy and 1 turn, is mostly correlated 434 experimental study435 toxicity.

However, based on the provided text, we can infer that pre-existing kidney conditions can increase the risk of nephrotoxicity from gadolinium-based contrast agents. The text mentions that patients with advanced or diabetic kidney disease are at higher risk of developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) after exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents. Additionally, the text suggests that patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <30 ml/min per 1.73 m² are at risk of developing NSF. 

To reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity during administration, the text recommends the following strategies:

1. Use the lowest dosage of the agent possible to achieve the image.
2. Avoid repeat exposures with Gd.
3. Consider performing the next examination 2 days after exposure.
4. Use a macrocyclic chelate (gadoteridol) instead of a linear chelate (gadodiamide).
5. Administer the contrast agent through a central venous catheter instead of a peripheral vein.

Patients with severe acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are particularly susceptible to developing NSF. Measures to reduce this risk during administration include using a macrocyclic chelate, which is preferred over linear chelates, minimizing the dosage of the contrast agent, avoiding repeat exposures, and considering alternative imaging modalities in high-risk patients. Additionally, it's important to adhere to recommendations such as those provided by regulatory agencies like the European Medicine Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding contraindications and warnings for specific contrast agents in patients with reduced kidney function.",0.9710537532923861,0.3333333333333333,0.41561615723207496

The context mentions that the factors affecting the adjustment of the dosage of an antifungal agent in the process of hemodialysis and hemofiltration are complex and varied, including:

1. Molecular weight of the drug
2. Distribution volume of the drug
3. Blood plasma protein binding rate
4. Filtration rate

These factors can affect the clearance of the drug during hemodialysis and hemofiltration. If the molecular weight of the drug is small and the blood plasma protein binding rate is low, the clearance of the drug will be higher during hemodialysis and hemofiltration.

I've analyzed the context and found the answer to your question.

The context mentions that high-dose NAC has been shown to reduce oxidative stress in some studies. Specifically, it is mentioned that activated oxygen protein products and oxidized low-density lipoprotein markers for oxidative stress were reduced by as much as 20% in the NAC group, whereas no change was evident in the placebo group.

Based on this information, I can provide the following answer:

How to use high-dose NAC to reduce oxidative stress?
Answer: High-dose NAC has been shown to reduce oxidative stress by reducing activated oxygen protein products and oxidized low-density lipoprotein markers.

Although the clinical significance is not clear, it is now recognized that etomidate, when used for induction for intubation, will suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis [185. 186]. Moreover, a  subanalysis of the CORTICUS trial [178] revealed that the use of etomidate before application of low-dose steroids was associated with an increased 28-day [187]. An inap- mortality rate propriately low random cortisol level (<18 ug/dL) in patient with shock would be considered an indication for traditional adrenal insufficiency steroid therapy a along guidelines.\n\nRationale.

1. For dialysis fluids, the following standards should be met:
	* Bacteria: < 100 CFU/mL
	* Endotoxins: < 0.03 EU/mL
2. The dialysis fluid should be prepared using aseptic techniques and stored in a sterile container.
3. The dialysis fluid should be tested for bacteria and endotoxins at the time of preparation and before use.
4. If the dialysis fluid does not meet the above standards, it should be discarded and a new batch prepared.
5. Patients with AKI should be monitored for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, or catheter-related infections.

It's also important to note that the guideline recommends using a dialysis fluid that is sterile and free of bacteria and endotoxins to minimize the risk of infection and endotoxemia.

"["" private hospitals in China. measures need be taken to further improve the quality of care and out comes of ICU patients in private hospitals In this study, ICU patients admitted to tertiary hospi tals in China had a lower CAUTI incidence than patients admitted to secondary hospitals. Being treated in a sec- I was associated with a higher CAUT] ondary hospital incidence in the multivariate analysis. The difference in the clinical care, o diagnostic protocols, assessment, and treatment of hospital infection might account for the observed. discrepancy in the CAUTI incidence among (CU patients. Recent studies have also observed higher mortality rates in secondary hospitals than in tertiary hospitals [21, 22]. These complications also reflect the combined effect of patient case-mix and quality of care In China, tertiary hospitals are usually comprehensive referral-based, general hospitals responsible for provid ing specialist health services and performing a larger role with regard to medical education and scientific research They also serve as medical hubs providing care to multi ole regions, while secondary hospitals are responsible for providing comprehensive health services, medical edu. cation and conducting research on a regional basis. Fo. one thing, patients with acute and critical illnesses tend to be treated in tertiary hospitals rather than secondary hospitals, resulting in a higher proportion of patients with acute and critical illnesses in tertiary care hospi tals, and for another, tertiary hospitals are usually more adequately staffed and equipped compared to secondary hospitals, which may lead to a lower rate of complica tions in ICU patients from tertiary hospitals. Intensive training and technical support for ICU staff in secondary hospitals should be implemented to narrow the gaps and variations in the care and outcomes of ICU patients We found 1 that an ICU-to-hospital bed percentage of more than 2% was independently associated with a lower mortality rate in ICU patients, which is consist. ent with a contemporary study 23]. Previous studies\n\nindicated that larger hospitals and hospitals with higl ICU occupancy were more likely to increase their num ber of ICU beds compared to other hospitals. Smal hospitals and hospitals with relatively low ICU occu pancy were less likely to add ICU beds in the subse- quent vear 24l. When the ICU occupancy rate is high lower ICU bed ratios could possibly result in delaved ICU : admissions. which in turn affect patient may outcomes It is noteworthy that the result should be interpreted with caution. A combination of factors including ICU bed occupancy rate, acuity of patients d capacity of and other departments (e.g.. operatior rooms), should be considered when the deci o making t sion whether to expand ICUs in a hospital A large number of studies have reported that a higher number of nursing staff was associated with a lower in-hospital mortality rate [7, 22, 25, 26]. Our study ICU with a showed a similar trend. Patients from an . bed-to-nurse ratio of more than 0.5 (two nurses per bed) had: The bed-to- significantly higher mortality. c of nurse staff nurse ratio is a widely used indicator ing in ICUs and general wards, and larger numbers of bed-to-nurses indicate worse staffing. ICU patients are highly dependent on nursing care due to the nature of their illnesses, the need for continuous invasive moni toring, and the need for multiple organ system support Variables that mediated the relationship between nurse staffing and the patient outcome of death were inferred to be insufficient collaboration, physician missed sive workload, increased medical errors. and nursing care 3, 27]. Moreover, one key role that ICU nurses perform is patient monitoring. ICU nurses are at the patient's bedside around the clock and are para. mount for the early identification of problems. Failure of such monitoring may cause life-threatening compli cations such as pneumothorax or unexpected extuba- tion, which requires prompt recognition and treatment 28. A shortage of nursing staff could be associated with insufficient supervision and might inhibit the early recognition of any changes in the status of the patients 25]. This finding could provide useful informatior for nurse managers and policymakers to o determine i staffing levels are adequate and safe, not just whether there is a relationship between staffing and outcomes This finding should be considered in light of the lower other low-and nurse-to-patient ratios China and middle-income countries. It should also be noted 1 that the average bed-to-nurse ratio used in this study would not be equal to the nurse-to-patient ratio of the units where the numbers of nurses and patients are in con. stant dynamic quality of c change.

Three RCTs compared the use of colloid to crystalloid resuscitation children with hypovolemic dengue shock with near 100 %s all treatment survival in arms [542-5441. In the industrialized world, two before- and-after studies. observed tenfold reductions in mortality when children ourpura/meningococcal septic shock with were treated with fluid boluses, inotropes, and mechanical ventilation in the community emergency department [545 5461. In one randomized trial, septic shock mortality was reduced (40-12 %) when increased fluid boluses, blood and inotropes we given to attain a Scvo2 monitoring 70 % [511l. A quality improvement goal of s reater than 7 study achieved a reduction in severe sepsis mortality from 4.0 to 2.4 %) with the delivery of fluid boluses and antibiotics in the first hour in a pediatric emergency department to reverse clinical signs of shock [547] Children 1 normally have a lower blood pressure than adults, and a fall in blood pressure can be prevented by rate Therefore vasoconstriction : and increasing heart 1 blood pressure : alone is not a reliable endpoint for assessing the adequacy of resuscitation. However, once hypotension occurs, cardiovascular collapse may soon follow. Thus. fluid resuscitation is recommended for both normotensive and hypotensive children in hypovolemic shock [542-5541. F Because hepatomegaly and/or rales occur in children who are fluid overloaded, these findings can be helpful signs of hypervolemia. In the absence of signs, large fuid deficits o exist, and initial volume resuscitation can require 40-60 mL/kg or more present, then fuid a adminis- however, if these signs are 1 should be ceased and diuretics should be given tration Inotrope infusions and mechanical ventilation are  com monly required for children with fluid refractory shock\n\nD.

Cohort studies show that delay in the use of therapies is associated with inotropic t major increases i mortality risk [553, 554].

According to the context, AKI is defined as a reduction in kidney function, including decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and kidney failure. The criteria for the diagnosis of AKI and the stage of severity of AKI are based on changes in serum creatinine (SCr) and urine output. 

Here are the specific criteria mentioned in the context:

* Criterion 1: Increase in SCr to ≥0.3 mg/dl (≥26.5 μmol/l) within 48 hours
* Criterion 2: Increase in SCr to ≥1.5 times baseline within 7 days
* Criterion 3: Urine output <0.5 ml/kg/h for 6-12 hours
* Criterion 4: Urine output <0.5 ml/kg/h for >12 hours

To determine whether a patient has AKI, the clinician should assess the patient's SCr and urine output and use these criteria to diagnose and stage the AKI.

Verdict: 1

After analyzing the provided contexts, I found that the significant updates recommended in the latest 'Surviving Sepsis Campaign' international guidelines for best practice statements are:

1. **Early goal-directed resuscitation**: The guidelines recommend early goal-directed resuscitation for patients with septic shock, with a focus on achieving a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mmHg and a central venous oxygen saturation of at least 70%.
2. **Limited use of vasopressors**: The guidelines suggest that vasopressors should be used judiciously and only when necessary, as excessive use can increase the risk of organ dysfunction and mortality.
3. **Procalcitonin-guided therapy**: The guidelines recommend using procalcitonin levels to guide antibiotic therapy, with a focus on reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment and minimizing the risk of antibiotic resistance.
4. **Limited use of sodium bicarbonate**: The guidelines suggest that sodium bicarbonate therapy should be used only in specific circumstances, such as severe metabolic acidosis, and not as a routine treatment for septic shock.
5. **Avoidance of over-anticoagulation**: The guidelines recommend avoiding over-anticoagulation in patients with se","[{'filename': 'Briegel-2017-[International guidelines from th.pdf'}

Specifying the recommendation for the rapid administration of antimicrobial therapy to be given 'as soon as possible after recognition and within the first hour of sepsis and septic shock' as a strong recommendation with moderate evidence level. 2. Introducing a Best-Practice-Statement recommendation for de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy, suggesting narrowing the antimicrobial spectrum after pathogen identification and resistance spectrum, or upon clinical improvement. 3. Recommending an optimized dosage of antimicrobial therapy for sepsis/septic shock based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. 4. Highlighting the increased distribution volume and changes in kidney and liver function in patients with sepsis or septic shock, emphasizing the need to avoid underdosing in antimicrobial therapy, considering specific differences among different drug classes.

* Hospital ownership: Tertiary hospitals are more likely to be public (94.22%) compared to secondary hospitals (88.45%).
* Location: Tertiary hospitals are more likely to be located in metropolitan cities (25.52%) compared to secondary hospitals (12.46%).
* Number of beds: Tertiary hospitals have a higher median number of beds (730, 491-1195) compared to secondary hospitals (506, 360-707).
* ICU-hospital bed percentage: Tertiary hospitals have a higher median ICU-hospital bed percentage (60.57%) compared to secondary hospitals (59.36%).

These differences suggest that tertiary hospitals tend to be larger, more urban, and have a greater proportion of ICU beds compared to secondary hospitals.

Firstly, in terms of region, a higher proportion of tertiary hospitals are located in Western China compared to secondary hospitals. Secondly, tertiary hospitals are more commonly situated in metropolitan cities compared to secondary hospitals, which are more prevalent in other cities and rural areas. Additionally, tertiary hospitals tend to have a higher ownership rate of public institutions compared to secondary hospitals. Moreover, tertiary hospitals generally have a larger number of beds, with a significant portion having more than 1000 beds, whereas secondary hospitals often have fewer beds, with a considerable proportion having less than 500 beds or between 500-1000 beds.",0.7690940384964469,0.8859828862994767,1.0

Although the cause in septic patients may be multi- tachycardia in elevated pulse with factorial, a decrease fluid resuscitation is often a useful marker of improving intravascular filling\n\n2. During the first 6 hrs of resuscitation of severe sepsis or septic shock, if central ve- mixed oxygen saturation venous nous oxygen saturation of 70% is not achieved with fluid resuscitation to a central venous of 8-12 Hg. t then transfuse mm pressure packed red blood cells to achieve a hemat ocrit of ≥30% and/or administer a dobut maximum of 20 amine infusion (up to μg-kg min ) to achieve this s goal.\n\nRationale, The protocol used in the study cited previously targeted an increase in mixed venous oxygen saturation to ≥70%. This was sequential institution of initial fluid achieved by resuscitation, then packed red blood cells, a and then dobutamine. This protocol was associated with an improvement in survival (5).\n\n### B. Diagnosis\n\n1. Appropriate cultures should always be ob- tained before antimicrobial therapy is ini- tiated.

The provided context is a set of tables and text discussing various aspects of acute kidney injury (AKI) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Based on the text, I can try to answer the question.

Fluid overload is a common complication in patients with MODS, particularly in those with AKI. According to Table 18, fluid overload is associated with increased mortality rates. The text states that in a multicenter prospective trial, the fluid overload rate was 29.6% in patients who died, compared to 10-20% in survivors.

The text also mentions that an aggressive use of diuretics and early initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) may improve survival in patients with AKI and MODS. However, it notes that the evidence is unclear on whether preventing earlier RRT will improve outcomes.

In terms of the correlation between fluid overload and mortality rates, the text suggests that there is a significant association between the two. The study mentioned earlier found that patients with fluid overload had a higher mortality rate compared to those without fluid overload.

Overall, based on the provided context, it appears that fluid overload is a significant risk factor for mortality in patients with MODS and AKI, and that","[{'filename': 'Sievert-2013-Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.pdf'}

Factors contributing to FO include the severity of illness and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). There is a clear correlation between fluid overload and mortality rates in these patients. Studies have shown that higher percentages of fluid overload are associated with increased mortality. For example, one study found a mortality rate of 65.6% in patients with more than 20% fluid overload, compared to 29.6% mortality in those with less than 10% fluid overload. Additionally, preventing or reducing fluid overload through interventions such as early initiation of RRT may improve outcomes, although strong evidence supporting this is currently lacking.",0.7910862235158238,0.8566181940020878,0.9356543414319763

However, I need to clarify that the provided context does not mention single-lumen catheters or non-single-lumen catheters. It seems that the context is related to the use of tunneled versus non-tunneled catheters in pediatric patients with acute kidney injury.

If you meant to ask about the differences between tunneled and non-tunneled catheters, I can provide an answer based on the context.

Answer: The provided context does not provide a direct answer to the question. However, it suggests that there is a need for further research to determine the differences in catheter function, catheter-related infections, and complications between tunneled and non-tunneled catheters in pediatric patients with acute kidney injury. The context also mentions that some studies have compared the outcomes of tunneled and non-tunneled catheters, but the results are not conclusive.

Therefore, the answer would be: ""The answer to the given question is not present in the context, and further research is needed to determine the differences in catheter function, catheter-related infections, and complications between tunneled and non-tunneled catheters in pediatric patients with acute kidney injury.""

For neonates, double-lumen 7F catheters are recommended for insertion into the femoral artery or vein. For patients weighing 3-6kg, double- or triple-lumen 7F catheters can be inserted into the jugular, subclavian, or femoral veins. Those weighing 6-15kg can have double-lumen 8F catheters inserted into the jugular, subclavian, or femoral veins, while those over 15kg may have double-lumen 9F or 10F catheters, or triple-lumen 12F catheters, inserted into the jugular, subclavian, or femoral veins. The choice between surgically placed Tenckhoff catheters and percutaneously placed catheters may also impact outcomes, with some studies suggesting fewer complications with surgically placed catheters. Research recommendations include investigating the use of tunneled versus non-tunneled catheters for acute kidney injury (AKI) patients to determine their effect on catheter function, catheter-related infections, and complications, as well as developing better methods for selecting access sites and balancing risks and benefits for individual patients.",0.0,0.3554955144715307,0.7669391559810963

The Work Group recommends, therefore, that the dose of contrast medium should be better expressed in relation to both volume and concentration, e.g., grams iodine, which also directly relates to the diagnostic capacity, the primary purpose of the contrast medium. Such ""double expression would also facilitate comparison between different studies on epidemiology and prognosis of CI-AKI. It is well known that, when measuring the plasma clearance of a GFR marker (e.g., with the contrast medium fohexol), the AUC is directly related to the dose of iohexol and inversely related to the GFR. Thus, by mathematically the AUC estimating and knowing the injected iodine AUC. Thus, dose, the GER can be calculated by dose AUC= dose - GFR, and AUC i directly related to the systemic exposure of a drug, including the contrast medium which, in with its efficacy and 1 turn, is mostly correlated 434 experimental study435 toxicity.

The 2008 SSC children recommendations reflected these findings, and the strength of the rhAPC recommendation was downgraded to a suggestion for use in adult patients with a clinical assessment of high risk of death, most of whom will have Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores >250 multiple organ failure (grade 2C: quality of evidence was C [7.

The drug was withdrawn from the market and is no longer available, negating need for an SSC recommendation regarding its use.\n\nO. Mechanical ventilation of sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome 1.We recommend that clinicians target a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg predicted body weight in patients with sepsis- distress syndrome (ARDS) induced acute respiratory (grade 1A vs. 12 mL/kg). 2. We recommend that plateau pressures be measured in with ARDS and that the initial upper limit patients 1 goal for plateau pressures in a passively inflated lung be 30 cmH,O (grade 1B).\n\nRationale. note, studies used to determine recom mendations in this section enrolled patients using criteria from the American-European Consensus Criteria Defini tion for Acute Lung Iniury (ALD and ARDS [2321 For this document., we have used the updated Berlin definition and used the terms mild moderate and severe ARDS (PaO- FIO2 <200. and <300.. <100 mm H dg. respectivelv) for nown as ALI and ARDS [2331 he syndromes previously k Several multicenter randomized trials have been formed in patients with established ARDS to evaluate the effects of limiting inspiratory pressure through moderation of tidal volume [234-2381. These studies showed differing results that may have been caused by differences in airwat: pressures in the treatment and control groups [233. 234 239]. Several meta-analyses suggest decreased mortality in patients with a pressure- and volume-limited strategy for established ARl DS [240. 2411 The largest trial of a volume- and pressure-limited an absolute 9 % decrease in all-cause showed strategy patients with ARDS mortality ventilated with tida volumes of 6 mL/kg compared with 12 mL/kg e of pre- dicted body and aiming for a plateau weight [233]. The use of lung-protective cm HO pressure strategies for patients with ARDS is supported b: clinica trials and has been widely accepted, but the precise choice of tidal volume for an individual patient with ARDS may require adjustment for such factors as the plateau pressure achieved, the level of PEEP chosen, the compliance of the compartment, and the vigor of the thoracoabdominal with patient\'s breathing effort. Patients profound meta- bolic acidosis, high obligate minute ventilations, or r short stature may require additional manipulation of tidal vol- umes.

The pressure can be maintained validity of this ceiling value will depend on the patient\'s effort, as those who are actively breathing generate higher transalveolar pressures for a given plateau pressure than\n\npatients whc o are passively inflated. Conversely, patients with very stiff chest walls may require plateau pressures >30 cmHO to meet vital clinical obiectives. A retro spective study suggested should be that : tidal volumes lowered even with plateau pressures <30 cmH-O [2441 as with decreased were associated lower plateau pressures in-hospital mortality [245] High tidal volumes that are coupled with high plateau pressures should be avoided in ARDS.

Three large relatively of multicenter trials using higher versus lower rlevels PEEP in conjunction s did not with low tida volumes uncover benefit or harm [255-257]. A meta-analysis using individual patient data showed no benefit in all patients\n\nwith ARDS; however, patients with moderate or severe ARDS (Pao-/FIo2 ratio <200 mm 1 Hg) had decreased with the use of higher PEEP. whereas those with mortality: mild ARDS did not [2581. Two options are recommended for PEEP titration. One option is to titrate PEEP (and tidal to bedside measurements of thoraco- volume) according pulmonary compliance with the obiective of obtaining the best compliance, reflecting a favorable balance of lung recruitment and overdistension [259]. The second option is to titrate PEEP based on severity of oxygenation deficit and guided by the Fio2 required to maintain adequate oxygenation [234, 255,256]. A PEEP>5 cm H,0is usually eARDSNet required to avoid lung collapse [260]. The standard PEEP strategy is shown in Appendix 3.

"['smaller and specialized hospitals, and the most substan- tial issues facing private hospitals are the recruitment of high-quality physicians and the lack of public insurance coverage. While public hospitals tvpically have more beds, staff, and tertiary care capacity, they usually allo. cate sufficient medical talent, equipment and resources to meet the needs of patients  19 . A recent study in Bei iing. China showed that the technical efficiency, pure rechnical efficiency, and scale efficiency of public hos.- pitals were higher than those of private hospitals [20: In addition, public hospitals usually have a better repu- tation than private hospitals, and reputation also influ- ences the performance and efficiency of hospitals. As a result, differences exist in the outcomes of ICU patients in public and private hospitals. With the rapid develonp ment of private hospitals in China. measures need be taken to further improve the quality of care and out comes of ICU patients in private hospitals In this study, ICU patients admitted to tertiary hospi tals in China had a lower CAUTI incidence than patients admitted to secondary hospitals. Being treated in a sec- I was associated with a higher CAUT] ondary hospital incidence in the multivariate analysis. The difference in the clinical care, o diagnostic protocols, assessment, and treatment of hospital infection might account for the observed. discrepancy in the CAUTI incidence among (CU patients. Recent studies have also observed higher mortality rates in secondary hospitals than in tertiary hospitals [21, 22]. These complications also reflect the combined effect of patient case-mix and quality of care In China, tertiary hospitals are usually comprehensive referral-based, general hospitals responsible for provid ing specialist health services and performing a larger role with regard to medical education and scientific research They also serve as medical hubs providing care to multi ole regions, while secondary hospitals are responsible for providing comprehensive health services, medical edu. cation and conducting research on a regional basis. Fo. one thing, patients with acute and critical illnesses tend to be treated in tertiary hospitals rather than secondary hospitals, resulting in a higher proportion of patients with acute and critical illnesses in tertiary care hospi tals, and for another, tertiary hospitals are usually more adequately staffed and equipped compared to secondary hospitals, which may lead to a lower rate of complica tions in ICU patients from tertiary hospitals. Intensive training and technical support for ICU staff in secondary hospitals should be implemented to narrow the gaps and variations in the care and outcomes of ICU patients We found 1 that an ICU-to-hospital bed percentage of more than 2% was independently associated with a lower mortality rate in ICU patients, which is consist. ent with a contemporary study 23].

Research suggests that balanced crystalloid fluid can reduce the occurrence of major kidney adverse events at 30 days. The greatest benefit of using balanced crystalloid fluid is seen in populations with high creatinine and high chloride levels. Compared to a restricted chloride strategy, a strategy involving chloride-containing solutions increases the risk of acute kidney injury and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT).

This strategy involves titrating PEEP levels based on bedside measurements of thoraco-pulmonary compliance, aiming for the best compliance to achieve a favorable balance of lung recruitment and overdistension. Alternatively, PEEP can be titrated based on the severity of oxygenation deficit, guided by the Fio2 needed to maintain adequate oxygenation. Additionally, avoiding high plateau pressures during ventilation and utilizing recruitment maneuvers in cases of severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS can help minimize lung injury.

After analyzing the given context, I found that the answer to the question is present in the context. Here's the answer:

""Tidal volume (TV) is a critical parameter in respiratory monitoring, as it is related to parameters such as arterial oxygen saturation (Sao₂), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and mechanical ventilation (MV) modes. The tidal volume is the amount of air that moves in and out of the lungs with each breath, and it plays a crucial role in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation. In the context of mechanical ventilation, tidal volume is used to set the ventilator rate, inspiratory time, and PEEP. The Sao₂, PEEP, and MV modes are all influenced by the tidal volume, as it affects the amount of oxygen delivered to the patient and the pressure exerted on the lungs. Therefore, tidal volume is an essential parameter in respiratory monitoring, as it helps clinicians to adjust the ventilator settings to achieve optimal oxygenation and ventilation.""

The context provides information on ventilation strategies, tidal volume selection, and the impact of factors like plateau pressure, PEEP, and patient characteristics on patient outcomes in ALI and ARDS. However, it does not provide specific therapeutic approaches that address ALI.

To provide a more accurate answer, I would need more context or information on the specific therapeutic approaches being referred to. If you could provide more context or clarify what you mean by ""therapeutic approaches that address ALI,"" I would be happy to try and assist you further.

For now, I can provide some general information on ventilation strategies and their impact on patient outcomes in ALI and ARDS. Studies have shown that using lung-protective ventilation strategies, such as limiting tidal volumes and plateau pressures, can improve patient outcomes in ALI and ARDS. These strategies aim to reduce lung injury and improve oxygenation by minimizing overdistension and barotrauma. Factors like plateau pressure, PEEP, and patient characteristics, such as body mass index and lung compliance, can impact tidal volume selection and the effectiveness of ventilation strategies.

I'd be happy to help you with your task. Based on the provided context, I'll answer your question and provide a verdict on whether the answer is present in the context.

Your question is: How do various factors like age, comorbidities, and ICU admission affect sepsis mortality, especially in children and the elderly, considering its underlying mechanisms?

Answer:
The answer is present in the context. The text mentions that the occurrence rate of sepsis and its complications significantly increased with age, and elderly septic patients with comorbidities were more likely to be hospitalized. The high mortality rate of sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock in the cohort might be explained by several reasons, including age, comorbidities, and withholding life-sustaining therapy. The text also mentions that the ICU admission rate among septic patients was low, which might also contribute to the observed high mortality rate.

From the context, it can be inferred that tumor lysis syndrome is a condition that should be anticipated when there are changes in solute burden. The context does not provide a detailed explanation of tumor lysis syndrome, but it implies that it is a condition that can occur when there are changes in solute burden, and it is related to acid-base regulation, renal support, and volume control.

Verdict: 1 (the answer is present in the context)

It is expected during shifts in solute burden because when there is a high turnover of cells, such as during cancer treatment, there is an increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome. This condition is particularly relevant concerning acid-base regulation, renal support, and volume control because the metabolic disturbances associated with tumor lysis syndrome can affect kidney function, fluid balance, and solute levels, requiring careful management to prevent complications.",0.575598888840633,0.782204820236418,0.5

Arginine availability is reduced in sepsis. which can lead to reduced nitric oxide synthesis, loss of microcirculatory regulation, and enhanced production of superoxide and peroxynitrite. However, arginine supple- mentation could lead to unwanted  vasodilation and hypotension [452, 4531. Human trials of L-arginine sup-  generally small and plementation have been renorted variable effects on mortality [454-4571 The only study ir septic patients showed improved survival, but had limi- tations in study design [4551. Other studies suggested nc benefit [449. 454. 4551 or possible harm [4551 in the septic patients. Some authors found subgroup improvement in secondary e outcomes in septic patients. such as reduced infectious complications [454 4551 and length of hospital stay [4541. but the relevance of these findings in the face of potential harm is unclear Glutamine. Glutamine levels are also reduced during critical illness. Exogenous supplementation can improve gut mucosal atrophy and permeability, possibly leading to reduced bacterial translocation. Other potential benefits enhanced immune function. decreased pro- are e cel inflammatory cytokine production, and higher levels glutathione and antioxidative capacity [452, 4531. How- ever. the clinical significance of theset findings is s no clearly established Although a previous meta-analysis showed I mortality reduction [428], four other meta-analyses did not [458- 462]. Other small studies not included in those meta- analyses had similar results [463, 4641. Three recent well- designed studies also failed to show a mortality benefit in the primary analyses 227, 465. 466 . but again. none focused specifically on septic patients. Two small studies on septic patients showed no benefit in mortality 1 rates 467, 468] but a significant reduction in infectious com- plications [467] and I a faster recovery orgar dysfunction 468. Some previous individual studies anc meta-analyses showed positive secondary outcomes, such as reduction in infectious morbidity 461. 462, 465 and dysfunction 462 . Beneficial effects were found organ c mostly in trials using parenteral rather than enteral glu- tamine. However, recent and well-sized studies could not demonstrate a reduction of infectious complications[227 dysfunction 465, 466 , even with parenteral or organ glutamine. An ongoing trial (REDOXS) of 1,200 patients will test both enteral and parenteral glutamine and anti- critically ill t supplementation in mechanically oxidant ventilated patients 469 . Although no clear benefit coulc be demonstrated in clinical trials with supplemental glu- tamine, there is no sign of harm The omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) are eicosanoid precur- sors. The prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes produced from EPA/GLA are less potent than their\n\narachidonic acid-derived equivalents, reducing the pro inflammatory impact on the immune response [452, 453].

However, please note that the context is a medical research paper discussing the effects of different feeding strategies and immune-enhancing nutritional supplements on outcomes in critically ill patients with severe infections and sepsis.

Answer: The context discusses the effects of different feeding strategies, including enteral and parenteral nutrition, as well as immune-enhancing nutritional supplements like arginine, glutamine, and omega-3 fatty acids, on outcomes in critically ill patients with severe infections and sepsis. The paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies to assess the effects of these strategies on mortality, morbidity, and other outcomes.

The paper concludes that:

* Enteral nutrition is associated with a lower risk of mortality and morbidity compared to parenteral nutrition.
* Immune-enhancing nutritional supplements, such as arginine, glutamine, and omega-3 fatty acids, have not consistently shown a mortality benefit in critically ill patients with severe infections and sepsis.
* However, some individual studies and meta-analyses have suggested that these supplements may have beneficial effects on secondary outcomes, such as reduced infectious morbidity and organ dysfunction.
* The paper recommends that goals of care and prognosis be discussed with patients and","[{'filename': 'Dellinger-2013-Surviving Sepsis Cam.pdf'}

Studies have shown mixed results regarding the benefits of various feeding strategies and supplements. Enteral feeding strategies, such as trophic feeding and full caloric early enteral feeding, have been compared, with inconclusive results regarding mortality but some evidence suggesting a reduction in infectious complications with trophic feeding. Parenteral nutrition has been compared to enteral nutrition, with some studies suggesting a higher incidence of infectious complications with parenteral nutrition. Immune-enhancing nutritional supplements like arginine and glutamine have shown variable effects on mortality, with some studies suggesting possible harm or no benefit. Omega-3 fatty acids have been associated with reduced pro-inflammatory impact on the immune response, but studies on their effects in critically ill patients have shown mixed results, with no clear benefit demonstrated in terms of mortality. Overall, while some studies suggest potential benefits of certain feeding strategies and supplements, more research is needed to establish clear guidelines for their use in critically ill patients with severe infections and sepsis.",0.6965103976279495,0.8674959846612951,0.8333333333333334

Note: The answer is present in the context, and the verdict is '1' as the information is available in the given context. The answer highlights the various factors that contribute to childhood acute renal failure, including dialysis types, fluid strategies, and patient outcomes. It discusses the use of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), and fluid overload, as well as the outcomes of pediatric patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The answer also mentions the importance of early recognition and management of AKI to improve patient outcomes.","[{'filename': 'Sievert-2013-Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.pdf'}
